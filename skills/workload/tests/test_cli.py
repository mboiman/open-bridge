"""The command line: what it BINDS, not what it prints.

Printing a verdict and returning it are not the same thing, and every case in
this file exists because they were confused. `validate --strict` ran a second,
independent gate, printed its judgements, and threw them away. A declaration the
schema refused exited 0. A machine without the validator -- the normal case on a
fresh clone -- exited 0 too, so the flag was a switch with no effect. And both
of those answers arrived two rows UNDER the line that says the run was clean.

The second half is the other end of the same wiring: `provision --yes` handed
`Outcome.findings`, a tuple of plain sentences, to `report.Report`, and answered
an AttributeError where the contract promises a report and an exit code of 1.

Nothing here touches a machine. The one process this file starts is a three line
shell script in a temporary directory, named `check-jsonschema` so that the real
`shutil.which` finds it: it is how the wiring from PATH to exit code is measured
without asking anyone to install a tool first.

    Found on a live machine on 2026-08-26. The half-hourly refresher calls
    reconcile twice on purpose, so that a failed publish cannot take the alarm
    with it. The first call carries `--notify`, and it also carried
    `--no-probe`; the second one probes and never notifies. The verdict a
    declaration paid for with its own `reconcile.probe` therefore reached a
    page and nothing else, and a run that was up but had stopped answering was
    red on a web page nobody was watching at three in the morning.

    Every link works: a failed probe classifies as `stopped` at high severity,
    `stopped` sits in the `failure` bucket, and a declaration asking for
    `failure` gets a message. The chain was simply never given an input,
    which is the same shape as a wrapper ending in a bare `exit 0`.

    The contradiction only exists where something declared a probe. Where
    nothing did, `--no-probe` asks to skip a measurement that was never going
