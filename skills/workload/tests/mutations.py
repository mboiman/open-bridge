"""The mutation battery: proof that the suite has teeth.

Every entry names a literal inside a source, the softened version of it, and the
ONE test that must turn red when the softening is applied. A suite that stays
green under any of these is not a suite: it would report a proof nobody ran,
which is worse than reporting none.

Each needle is a real defect, not an invented one. Seven were live in this tree
and were found by an audit; two more guard behaviour that had no test at all
until that audit pointed at the gap.

The last block came out of a second audit, which softened the code under six
cases that LOOKED like checks and watched the whole suite stay green. Each of
those six now has its own needle here. One of them names `tests/conftest.py`
rather than an engine source, deliberately: the machine guard is code too, it is
the only thing keeping this suite off live boxes, and in a green run it never
fires, so nothing but a needle would ever notice it had stopped refusing.

A third audit produced the block after that. Three of its findings were real
defects in behaviour rather than weak tests: `reconcile` reported a run over a
mistyped id as clean, `run-tests.sh` scored an all-skipped run green, and a
deadline of `inf` or `nan` reached `proc.wait` as no deadline at all. The rest
were eight more cases whose NAME promised a property their BODY did not measure.
Two of that block's needles name `scripts/tests/tally.awk` and the wrapper: the
runner's own verdict is code, and so is a backend helper that both `render` and
`preflight` reach through.

A needle may only name a test that RUNS in the scratch copy. FIVE cases depend
on files that live in the repository and not in this skill (the declaration
schema, the declaration template, and the surface the leak scan reaches across);
they skip there, by name and with a reason, and naming one of them here would
score a skip as a pass. The count was written down as three, and the tally is
what corrected it: it now prints the skips instead of folding them into the
total, so a detached run says `351/356 green, 5 skipped` where it used to say
`356/356 green`. The same rule is enforced at the other end too, where it
matters most: a run in which EVERY case skipped is red.

`run-tests.sh --mutate` copies the skill into a scratch directory, applies one
mutation at a time, runs the named test there, and asserts it fails. The working
tree is never touched.
