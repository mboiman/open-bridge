    what makes an absent run detectable at all. Without it, nothing
    distinguishes a run that failed from a run that never started." It writes
    that line faithfully and nothing in the engine ever reads it back, so the
    sentence describes a capability the skill does not have.

    That is the third member of the family this file keeps finding: a signal
    that exists and is never consulted. `missing` is listed in `notify_on` as
    "the one nobody has today", and it stayed that way.

    What is deliberately NOT claimed here: an expected firing can only be
    computed where the declaration states a cadence outright, which is `interval`
    and its `every_sec`. A recurring run needs an RRULE engine the skill does not
    carry on purpose, so for those kinds the answer is "cannot say", said out
    loud, and never a quiet pass.
