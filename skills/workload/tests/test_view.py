    Measured from the published page on 2026-08-24, after the two label columns
    landed. The table had grown to nine columns inside a 68rem page. Seven of
    them carry a single short token and take their width unconditionally, two
    of them carry prose: the purpose under the id, and the reason under the
    state. The seven won, because a token that refuses to wrap always wins
    against a sentence that can.

    What the reader got: `state`, the one column the table exists to answer,
    squeezed to roughly a tenth of the page while a full English sentence tried
    to fit inside it. The complaint was two words long and exact: too small.

    The earlier fix (ASentenceIsNotAnIdentifier) stopped a sentence from
    breaking the layout. It did not give the verdict any room, because the
    reason still sat in the same narrow cell. So the reason leaves the row: it
    is prose, and prose belongs at the page's measure, not in a column that
    every added label makes narrower.

    What these tests prove: the reason is rendered outside the cell grid, on a
    row of its own that spans the table; each reason still names the state it
    belongs to, so the mapping survives the move even where one run carries
    several findings; the verdict column is floored so the next column added
