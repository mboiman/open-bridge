    """The seam between the hand written gate and the declaration schema.

    They are two independent implementations on purpose: two gates that read the
    same document are one gate with a second name, and this one exists so it can
    fail differently. What that buys is only worth something while they agree on
    the VERDICT for anything this skill would actually start.

    For one round they did not. Rules lived in the schema alone -- absolute
    paths, an environment value that is a locator, a recipient that is a slug,
    and a schedule carrying only its own kind's trigger -- so `validate`
    answered clean where `validate --strict` refused. That is worse than having
    one gate, because the quiet one is the gate the LAYER THAT ACTS consults:
    `provision.plan` calls `model.validate` and never the schema, which needs a
    tool that is not installed everywhere. A plaintext secret, a relative
    argv[0] and a oneshot carrying a cadence all reached a machine on a path
    where nothing refused them.

    The two are NOT equal in coverage and this case does not pretend otherwise.
    The schema is a document gate and carries shape, type, enum and
    `additionalProperties` rules over every field including the ones that are
    only ever documentation; the hand written gate carries cross field rules
    over what this skill RUNS. So the invariant asserted here is the one that is
    both true and load bearing:

        no declaration the schema refuses may pass the hand written gate while
        being a run this skill would start.

    "Would start" is read off the declaration: owner `bridge`, and a runtime
    that is not one of the inert ones. Everything else is documented, never
    touched, and the schema being stricter about it is a difference and not a
    disagreement.

    It reads the schema's own negative controls, which live in the repository
