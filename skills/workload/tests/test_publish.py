"""publish: putting the page where a browser reaches it, and the two ways that lies.

The first lie is about the destination. A served directory usually belongs to
something already: a puller that rsyncs it back, another system's views. Writing
into it works, and then either the next sync deletes this page without a word or
this page overwrites theirs. So the destination has to be *proved* ours before a
single byte moves, and the proof is a marker inside it, the same shape the rest
of this skill uses for the units it owns.

The second lie is one word for two facts. Bytes landing on a disk and a browser
receiving them are different questions with different failure modes: a file in
the wrong directory lands perfectly and is never served. "Published" collapses
them, so this module never says it. It says delivered, and separately reachable,
and reachable stays unknown rather than false where nobody asked.
