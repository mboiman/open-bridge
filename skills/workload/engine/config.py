"""Repository root discovery and the `workloads:` block of the bridge config.

Every path, prefix and deadline this skill uses comes from here. That is what
keeps the code generic: an instance name, a personal path or a label prefix in
a source file is exactly what makes a skill unpromotable, so nothing of the
kind may appear anywhere except as a default in this file.

An absent `workloads:` block yields the defaults. It is never a crash: a Bridge
that has not configured this skill still has to be able to run it.
