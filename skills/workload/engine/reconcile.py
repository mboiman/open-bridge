"""Is it still there? Asked of three sources, never of a declared status field.

The three sources are the declaration under ``workflow/workloads/``, the live
machine, and the ``services[]`` inventory of ``infra/remotes/<host>.yaml``.
A ``status:`` field is not among them on purpose: a declared state is never the
truth, the service manager is.

The module is strictly read only. It may propose an inventory patch; it never
applies one, and no step it runs may change anything on a machine.

``classify`` is pure, so the whole state machine is provable without a box.
Two verdicts carry the weight:

* ``retired_but_live``, a declaration marked retired whose unit is nonetheless
  running. The loudest thing this skill can say, because for one real
  declaration a start would be a security incident.
* ``unknown``, meaning an unreachable host, an expired probe, an expect nobody
  can evaluate, a placeholder nobody resolved. It must never collapse into
  ``absent``; that collapse is how seventeen jobs were once declared overdue
  when they were merely unobserved.

    a live source`, and that is false: the units were listed, the ownership
    stamps were read and the traces the guard wrote were read, which is where
