"""view: the declared runs as one page a human reads.

The easiest place in this skill to state something nobody measured. A page has
no return code, nobody diffs it, and a green tick on it reads as proof to the
person looking. So three rules shape everything here.

**It repeats the honest sentence.** `reconcile` already says in words whether a
live source was asked, and how many of the declarations it reached. That
sentence is carried through verbatim AND as a structural attribute, because a
reader who skips the prose still has to be able to tell "these are running"
from "these are the declarations".

**It shows every declaration, including the ones nothing was said about.** A
page built from findings alone drops a workload nobody reported on, and an
absent row reads as a healthy one.

**Its data is never markup.** A declaration is a file a human writes and a
finding quotes a machine, so both are untrusted text and both are escaped.

Self-contained by construction: no font CDN, no script src, no image host. A
dashboard that fetches anything logs the reader's address somewhere else and
stops working the moment the machine is offline. Colours and type follow the
repository's DESIGN.md tokens rather than being invented here.

    A renderer that reads its own clock produces different bytes on every run,
    which makes a diff meaningless and a golden impossible.

    `stale_after_min` is the other half of that. On a terminal an age is free:
    you just ran the command. A page on a web server is read hours later, looks
    exactly the same, and is believed. The renderer cannot know when it will be
    read, so it states no freshness at all; it publishes the moment in a form a
    machine can parse and lets the reader's own clock decide. A threshold is
    honoured only when the caller declares one, because without a refresh
    cadence there is no line to draw and inventing one is a number nobody chose.

    `hosts` is which machines were actually reconciled. It is not a filter and
    never removes a row: it is what lets a silence about a run placed somewhere
    else be explained instead of reported as an unexplained one. Empty means no
    machine was excluded, so there is nothing to explain.

    `links` is the bar of neighbouring pages, as (label, href) pairs out of the
    caller's configuration. Empty renders nothing, and nothing is the normal
    case: this page has never opened any of them, so the bar navigates and
    states nothing else. See `LINKS_NOTE`.

    `machine_units` is which of the machine's undeclared units to list rather
    than count, as label prefixes. See `elsewhere`: on a machine carrying two
    thousand of them, listing all and counting all are equally useless, and
    which ones belong to the reader is not something this skill may decide by
    looking at a name.

    `overview_label` names the first tab. Every other tab is named by the
    configuration that asked for it, so without this one the shell would carry
    exactly one word the caller cannot choose, in whatever language this file
    happens to be written in. Empty keeps the default.

    `panels` frames neighbouring pages instead of linking them, same shape and
    same source, and each one becomes a VIEW of its own under the shared bar at
    the top. A frame shows the neighbour's own rendering under the neighbour's
    own stamp, so no figure is adopted and nothing is drawn twice; see
    `PANELS_NOTE` and `_panels_html` for why it is a view and not a footer.
