    A script whose last line is a bare `exit 0` breaks the FIRST link, and
    everything after it then works perfectly on an input that never arrives.
    Between 2026-08-24 and 2026-08-26 that produced 441 traces reading
    `verdict=ok` and not one non-zero exit, across three runs that could not

    for it, and the reason confused retrying with reporting.

    It lives here rather than in `model.validate` because it needs the
    repository root, which that gate has never had and should not get: it is
    asked by `provision` as well, and a gate that reads files needs a
    reachability and a deadline that a pure invariant check does not.

    FOUR SILENCES, each deliberate:

    - No `failure` in `notify_on`: nothing was promised, so nothing is hollow.
    - No path inside this repository: the declaration may name a program, or a
      script on another machine whose home is not this one. `relative_to`
      answers that, never a prefix comparison, and a path outside stays silent
      instead of being guessed at.
    - The file is not there: that is a different fact and deserves its own
      sentence, not this one. Saying it here would report an absence as a
      violation on every machine that keeps the file elsewhere.
    - The bytes do not decode: a binary has no last line, and reading one for
