"""The vocabulary, and the repository side of the world.

Declarations go in, typed objects come out, plus the enums, constants and
digests every other module speaks. This module knows nothing about machines,
subprocesses or unit file formats: it is the half of the skill that can be
reasoned about without a box.

Three things here are deliberate rather than convenient.

* ``validate`` is HAND WRITTEN and never reads the JSON schema file. Two gates
  that read the same document are one gate with a second name; this one exists
  precisely so it can fail differently.
* Schema defaults are materialised at load time. ``isolation``,
  ``single_flight`` and ``on_timeout`` each encode an incident, so an absent
  field has to arrive as the safe value, never as ``None``.
* Writing back into a declaration is a surgical line edit. A dump round trip
  would silently drop the comments and the editor hint line that carry the why.

# ── What a declared value may be, before it is written into a file ───────────
# Every generated artifact of this skill is LINE BASED and every one of them
# writes declared values into it: a systemd directive, a crontab line, a shell
# assignment in the guard script. A value that carries a line break does not
# arrive escaped there, it arrives as the NEXT directive. So the shape of a
# value is an invariant of the declaration, not a detail of one renderer, and
# it is decided once, here, where both the gate and the backends can read it.

#: The id is not only a name. It becomes a unit file NAME, a launchd label, a
#: systemd `Unit=` reference and a path element inside the guard script, in
#: every case unquoted. A slug is the only shape that means the same thing in
#: all four. Written out by hand rather than read off the declaration schema:
#: the two gates carry the same rule on purpose and still fail differently.
ID_PATTERN = re.compile(r"^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$")

#: A POSIX environment variable name. The KEY is never quoted by anybody: it is
#: written bare on the left of `Environment=NAME=...` and bare on the left of a
#: shell assignment in the guard script. A key that is not a name is executable
#: text in the second place and a parse error in the first.
ENV_NAME_PATTERN = re.compile(r"^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$")

#: Refused in every declared value that reaches a generated file, with the name
#: to say out loud. A NUL cannot be represented in any of the three formats at
#: all; the two line breaks end the directive they sit in and hand whatever
#: follows to the parser as a new one.
FORBIDDEN_IN_VALUES = (
    ("\x00", "a NUL byte"),
    ("\n", "a line break"),
    ("\r", "a carriage return"),
)

#: Absolute, in the three places a path is handed to a SERVICE MANAGER rather
#: than to a login shell: the interpreter, the working directory and argv[0].
#: A service manager starts a unit with a short PATH and no shell, so `claude`
#: resolves to something else than it does in a terminal, or to nothing, and a
#: tilde is a literal character nobody expands. On macOS a relative interpreter
#: is additionally a DIFFERENT TCC client, with none of the grants the real one
#: has. The declaration schema carries the same `^/` on all three; this is the
#: hand written half of it, spelled out here rather than read off that document,
#: so the two gates hold the same rule and still fail differently.
ABSOLUTE_PATH_PATTERN = re.compile(r"^/")

#: A path SEGMENT that is nothing but a version number. Two independent silent
#: failures hang on it, which is why it is refused rather than warned about.
#:
#: The file goes away. A versioned directory exists in order to be replaced, so
#: the next upgrade removes the one the declaration names and the unit starts
#: nothing at all.
#:
#: And on macOS the privacy grant goes away with it. TCC keys a grant on the
#: literal client path, so a new version is a new client that was never granted
#: anything. Measured, not assumed: six consecutive claude versions each hold
#: their own row under `.local/share/claude/versions/<version>`, and five of
#: them grant nothing, because each update wrote a path nobody had answered a
#: prompt for. The same database carries rclone twice, once under a Cellar path
#: that moves and once under a stable one that does not.
#:
#: The optional trailing group is Homebrew's revision suffix (`1.10.1_1`). The
#: optional leading `v` is the other common spelling. A segment with no dot is
#: not a version: `report2` and `python3` stay untouched on purpose, because a
#: digit in a name is not a version number and refusing one would be a guess.

#: Privacy grants a workload can declare it depends on, named after the pane a
#: human has to open to give one. A closed list, because the value's whole job
#: is to send a person to the right place: a typo would send them to a pane that
#: does not exist, and they would find nothing and conclude the grant is fine.
#: Nothing here is checked against the machine. macOS protects the TCC database
#: from being read or written by anything but itself, so a declaration can say
#: what it NEEDS and never what it HAS.

#: Interpreters the whole machine already shares. A grant is issued to a PATH,

#: every program that will ever run at that path, including the ones somebody
#: else chooses. Full Disk Access on `/usr/bin/python3` is Full Disk Access for
#: every python script on the box.
#:
#: This scar is already paid. The calendar exporter needs a total read, and a
#: shared `uv` would have handed the same total read to an internet reachable
#: agent whose file tool takes absolute paths. The fix was a second frozen copy
#: at its own path, which is what a dedicated client means here.
