"""The guard script: what a backend does not promise, supplied around the run.

Four promises can be missing, and every one of them has a scar behind it:

  deadline            a run without one held a machine for three and a half
                      hours and nobody noticed until the next morning
  process group kill  ending only the direct child leaves a grandchild holding
                      the output pipe, and the cleanup then blocks forever,
                      which is the exact shape of that hang
  single flight       one job lost 53 of 181 runs to overlapping starts, in
                      silence
  missing detection   a run that never happened is the failure nobody sees; a
                      trace line per run is what makes its absence visible

The script is POSIX sh. Not bash: `/bin/sh` on macOS is not bash, and a bashism
here fails at 06:10 on a machine nobody is watching. It does not reach for
`timeout(1)` either, because a stock macOS does not ship it.
