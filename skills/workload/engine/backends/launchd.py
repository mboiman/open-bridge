"""launchd, in two domains built from one implementation.

The user domain (`gui/<uid>`) is what the skill provisions. The system domain
is planned and printed, never executed: no sudo, ever, on a machine carrying
live services.

Three things here are scars, not style:
  * a replace is bootout then bootstrap, never kickstart, because kickstart
    does not reload a unit whose file changed
  * a disable is a persistent `launchctl disable` PLUS the reason, because only
    disable survives a reboot and a renamed file loses the why
  * the domain target carries the uid discovered on the host, never a number
    written into this file
