"""Exception tree for the workload skill.

Two properties make this file load bearing for every other module.

1. ``code`` is a stable kebab string. Tests assert on it, so a refusal for the
   wrong reason still fails. Never rename one to make a test pass; the code is
   the contract.
2. ``exit_code`` is where the process exit map lives, so the command line stays
   pure wiring. 2 = usage, config or declaration; 3 = refused by a guard;
   4 = unreachable or timed out. A timed out call is a REPORTED error and can
   therefore never share the clean run's 0.

Every error accepts either a finished message or a set of named fields, and
composes a message out of the fields when none was given. The fields also land
as attributes, so a caller can act on ``err.rc`` or ``err.argv`` without parsing
prose back out of a string.
