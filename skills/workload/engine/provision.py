"""The only module that changes a machine.

The shape is observe -> plan -> apply -> verify, and the middle step is pure on
purpose: the whole decision table can be driven row by row without a box in
sight, which is the only way the interesting refusals are provable at all.

Three things this module never does. It never derives state from the
declaration: ``present``, ``running`` and every digest come from the live
object. It never reports success without a verify that passed at that live
object. And it never elevates: a step that needs root is printed for a human,
because escalating silently on a box carrying live services is not on the table.

    `retire --yes --dry-run` booted the unit out, disabled it, deleted the guard
    script and wrote `retired:` into the declaration. Exit code 0, no hint.

    So the decision is taken HERE and it is fail closed on both axes: an explicit
    dry run never stops anything, and neither does a run nobody confirmed.
