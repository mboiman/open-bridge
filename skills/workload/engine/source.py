"""Is the program that runs the program that is KEPT.

`in_sync` compares a unit against the artifact it was rendered from and the
stamp that records the rendering. Neither of those is the program the unit
CALLS. A wrapper that lives outside the repository and drifted from its twin
runs happily forever, and a change in the repository never reaches it, without
an error appearing anywhere. Measured on one machine on 2026-08-25: five such
pairs, and two watchdogs that existed only on that box, a hundred and thirty
lines ahead of the repository's copy, one disk failure from gone.

THIS MODULE DOES NOT DECIDE WHICH SIDE IS RIGHT. In no two of those five pairs
was it the same side: once the repository's version was the maintained one,
once the machine's, and once rolling out would have pointed a fallback path at
nothing. Deciding is a question for a person; NOTICING that two exist and have
come apart is a question for a machine, and that is the half that was missing.

Three answers, and the third is the dangerous one:

  ``in the repository``  the program's path ends in a path the repository
                         itself carries, so it IS that file and drift is
                         structurally impossible.
  ``a copy``             it sits elsewhere and the repository holds a file of
                         the same name. Then the digests decide.
  ``only on the machine``it sits elsewhere and the repository holds no such
                         file at all. This program exists on one disk.

A shared interpreter is not a program, it is the language the program is
written in. Counting `/bin/bash` would make almost every run a copy.
