"""publish: put the rendered page where a browser reaches it, and prove both halves.

A page in `.bridge/` is a file somebody has to know about. A page on a web
server is a page that gets looked at, and that difference is the whole reason
this module exists. It also introduces two ways to be wrong that the terminal
never had.

**The destination usually belongs to something already.** A served directory is
rarely empty: a puller rsyncs it back on every commit, another system writes its
own views there. Publishing into such a directory works, and then one of two
things happens without a word: the next sync deletes this page, or this page
overwrites theirs. So the destination is *proved* ours before a byte moves, and
the proof is a marker file inside it. That is the same shape the rest of this
skill uses for the units it owns, for the same reason: a directory cannot be
recognised by its name, only by something in it that says who wrote it.

**Delivered and reachable are two facts, and one word for both would hide the
gap between them.** Bytes landing on a disk and a browser receiving them fail
independently: a file in the wrong directory lands perfectly and is never
served, and a server pointed at a different root serves something else with a
cheerful 200. So this module never says "published". It says delivered, proved
by reading the bytes back off the machine, and separately reachable, proved by
fetching the URL and comparing what came out. Where no URL was given, reachable
stays unknown rather than false: nobody asked, and false would be a claim.

**A page is often not one file.** A stylesheet, a second view, a data file the
page links to: they are delivered beside it, byte for byte, and each one is
proved the same way. They never share the page's verdict, because "the page
arrived and its stylesheet did not" is a third situation, and one boolean
cannot say which of the three happened.
