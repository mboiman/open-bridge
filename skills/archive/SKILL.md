  Archive the current period — collect log entries, generate summary, distil

  check upstream. Period follows work.archive_cadence (weekly | bi-weekly |
  monthly | quarterly | yearly). Supports --force mode.

# Archive

Periodic archive workflow. Read the referenced file ONLY when triggered.

The period is **configurable** — `bridge-config.yaml` `work.archive_cadence`
(`weekly` default, then `bi-weekly` / `monthly` / `quarterly` / `yearly`).
The same key drives `/briefing`'s staleness warning, so the reminder and the
archiver always agree on what "overdue" means.

Archiving **distils before it resets**: `work/archive/` has no reader, so
without a distil step archiving would be forgetting with a backup. Phase 5
proposes durable facts for the memory base — which *is* loaded every session
— and never writes one without confirmation
([`rules/learning-autonomy.md`](../../rules/learning-autonomy.md)).

## Arguments

| Argument | Effect | Default |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `(none)` | Archive the oldest closed period, per `work.archive_cadence` | — |
| `--force` | Archive the current (in-progress) period too | false |
| `--no-distil` | Skip Phase 5; archive without proposing memories | false |

## Prerequisites

`bridge-config.yaml` with `work.enabled: true`. If not: inform and exit.
