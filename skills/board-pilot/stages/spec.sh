# Turns a board item into an implementation plan the `implement` stage reads. The
# plan is the first thing a human can disagree with, so it is a real artefact and
# not a thought the model had once.
#
# READ-ONLY ON THE REPO, by two independent mechanisms: the fence grants no Write or
# Edit tool at all, and the script itself writes the plan from the model's stdout.
# That is tighter than the precedent, which hands over Write and then polices the
# damage with a scoped-dirty check — here there is no write to police.
#
# The plan lands in $EVIDENCE_DIR (durable per item, across ticks) and NOT in the
# repo: a plan committed to the branch would show up in the PR diff, and the diff is
# supposed to be the change, not the paperwork about the change.

#
# ITEM_BODY_FILE is the REQUIREMENT and this stage's real input — see bp_story_block.
# It is deliberately NOT asserted below: a missing story degrades to a topic hint (the
# behaviour before it existed), it does not kill a live item.

PROMPT="You are planning ONE change to THIS repository (the current working directory). Read the actual code, configs and docs with your read tools before you write anything.

Your standard is in the file ${CRITERIA_FILE}. Read it FIRST and hold the plan to it.

$(bp_story_block)

Write an implementation plan as Markdown to STDOUT and nothing else. No preamble, no
commentary, no questions. Cover: what the change is; which real files it touches (cite
paths you actually read); the order of work, tests first; what would make it WRONG; and
what you are unsure about. Assert only what the files support; mark anything uncertain as
such. A plan that only restates the requirement has done nothing — the requirement is
where you start, the analysis is what you deliver. If the task is not doable as
described, say so plainly and explain why — a plan that says 'this cannot be done as
asked' is a valid, useful plan.
