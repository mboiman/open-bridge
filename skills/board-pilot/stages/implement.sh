# The only stage that writes code, and the only one that pushes. It is also the
# rework target of BOTH reject edges (verify and review both send an item back
# here), so it must read $REJECTION_NOTE_FILE and $BOUNCES to know which round it
# is in — the board already knows; without these the stage cannot say.
#
# Order is load-bearing: refuse -> resolve -> branch -> model -> scan -> commit ->
# push. The branch refusal and the binary resolution are free and come first. The
# precedent runs the model at line 38 and refuses the protected branch at line 67 —
# paying for a full run before declining to use it.

# Env from the runner: ITEM_ID ITEM_TITLE ITEM_URL ITEM_BODY_FILE BRANCH PROJECT
# EVIDENCE_DIR CRITERIA_FILE BOUNCES REJECTION_NOTE_FILE. cwd = the target repo clone.
#
# The plan is the route; ITEM_BODY_FILE is the DESTINATION. Both are needed: a plan can
# be wrong, and when it is, the requirement is the only thing left to check it against.

# anyone with repo push access can have poisoned. Every commit this stage mints
# carries "board-pilot ${ITEM_ID}" in its body (the second -m at the bottom), so every
# commit already ahead of base must carry it too. KNOWN RESIDUAL: the marker is a
# tripwire, not authentication — push access to the repo can forge it; the boundary
# that actually holds is who has push access. origin/<base> is fresh (bp_ensure_branch
