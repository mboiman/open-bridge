# THE EXIT-CODE CONTRACT, which is the single most load-bearing thing in this chain:
#
#   red tests   (suite rc 1..125)      -> write {"verdict":"reject", ...} to $VERDICT_FILE and EXIT 0
#   green       (suite rc 0)           -> write nothing and EXIT 0
#   cannot run  (no/vacuous BP_VERIFY_CMD, or suite rc >= 126) -> EXIT non-zero
#
# A red test is a REVIEW VERDICT, not an infra crash. The stage RAN CLEANLY; it has
# a finding. Exiting non-zero on red would mean ok=False, which takes the on_fail
# edge (retry/park/rewind) instead of the capped reject edge — and the engine only
# consults the verdict sidecar `if stage.reject_to and result.ok`, so a non-zero exit
# also throws the verdict away unread. Rework would then ride an edge whose counter
# `attempts.reset()` wipes: the unbounded-spend loop, measured at 40 paid runs in 40
# ticks. This exit 0 is why the delivered chain needs no rewind edge at all.
#
# NO MODEL RUNS HERE. This stage is the only [machine] evidence in the dossier; a
# model anywhere in it would make the one independent signal an opinion again.
#
# Env from the runner: ITEM_ID BRANCH VERDICT_FILE EVIDENCE_DIR. Declares
# `evidence: true`, so the ENGINE tees this script's stdout/stderr/exit code — that
# is why the output goes to stdout plainly and is never piped.

# verify stage that cannot find a suite and reports green is worse than no stage.
#
# There is deliberately NO fallback heuristic. Guessing a suite from the CWD ties
# the verdict to the runner box's environment: a live run guessed `python3 -m
# pytest -q` on a box whose python3 has no pytest, the rc=1 became a reject note
# reading "No module named pytest", and a paid rework round was spent proving that
# no repo change can install a module on the runner. The operator names the suite,
