"""Real StageRunner adapter — dispatches a Stage to a subprocess.

This is the production runner. It maps a handler ref to a concrete invocation:

  * ``cmd:<shell>``      → run the argv with ``shell=False``. The command string
                           is split with ``shlex.split`` and executed as an argv
                           list. Board-sourced values (item id, url, title) are
                           NEVER interpolated into the command string — they are
                           exported into the child's environment as ITEM_ID /
                           ITEM_URL / ITEM_TITLE so a malicious title can't break
                           out into the shell.
  * ``skill:<name>`` /
    ``agent:<name>`` /
    ``workflow:<harness>`` → spawn ``claude -p`` (CLI-over-API, per the Bridge
                           "Claude CLI statt API" rule) with a prompt that names
                           the skill/agent/workflow and the concrete item.

The EVIDENCE TEE lives here, and it is the reason this module owns the sink at
all: only the parent holds ``proc.stdout`` / ``proc.stderr`` / ``proc.returncode``.
For a stage with ``evidence: true`` the parent writes those into
``<evidence_dir>/<stage_id>/`` itself. Letting the evaluated stage write its own
evidence file and then labelling it "captured output" is a lie an existence check
cannot catch — a stage that TYPES ``5 passed in 0.15s`` passes such a check
identically to one that ran pytest. Reading from the pipe makes the output
unforgeable by the stage's text, because the stage never authors it.

It is NOT exercised by the deterministic test suite (that drives FakeStageRunner
in runner.py); this half only runs against a real shell + `claude` binary.

Async upgrade path (future): long stages should be DETACHED — spawn the
subprocess (``subprocess.Popen`` without ``wait``), record its pid + a heartbeat
file, return immediately, and let the engine poll the lock heartbeat (see
engine/lock.py) to decide when the stage finished. For the MVP this runner is
SYNCHRONOUS with a timeout: ``run`` blocks until the child exits or the timeout
fires. Swapping to the detached model only touches ``_spawn`` — the StageRunner
port shape stays identical.
