"""board-pilot `tick` CLI — the launchd entrypoint.

One invocation = exactly ONE engine tick. There is NO internal sleep loop:
the launchd timer (StartInterval, see assets/com.example.board-pilot.plist) is the
clock, so a hung tick can never wedge the loop and `--once` is the only mode.

Usage:
    python3 -m engine.cli --project <path-to-project-yaml> --state-dir <dir> [--once] [--dry-run]

Wiring:
    EngineConfig   ← engine.config.load_pipeline_from_yaml(project_yaml)
    BoardClient    ← engine.gh_board.GhBoardClient   (real GitHub Projects v2 adapter)
    StageRunner    ← engine.claude_runner.ClaudeStageRunner(dry_run=...)
    Engine         ← engine.tick.Engine(config, board, runner, state_dir)

The engine config (stages, trigger, budget) is generic. The board/repo BINDING
(project number, owner, the two single-select field names, the backing repo) is
project-specific and lives in a `board:` block in the SAME project YAML; the CLI
reads it raw to construct the two adapters. See assets/pipeline.example.yaml.

The two real adapters (gh_board, claude_runner) are filled in by the build
workflow. If they are absent the CLI must fail loudly with a clear message
rather than tracebacking — guarded below.

Prints a single one-line JSON summary of the TickResult to stdout (the launchd
StandardOut log is a clean, greppable ledger of every tick).
