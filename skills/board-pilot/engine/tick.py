  2. ARM: every item sitting in the trigger column with no pipeline yet gets
     pipeline = "queued" (the board pipeline field is the durable marker, so a

  3. advance each in-flight item by exactly ONE stage (confirmed-advance: the next

  4. the gated PR stage opens a PR at most once (idempotent), sets the human
