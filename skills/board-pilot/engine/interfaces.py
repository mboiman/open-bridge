"""Shared interfaces: data records + the two ports the engine depends on.

Decision A (engine-owned program counter): a board item carries a human-owned
`status` (the trigger source — a person drags it to `Todo`) AND an engine-owned
`pipeline` field (the durable program counter). The engine reads `status` only to
ARM an item; from then on it tracks progress via `pipeline`, so a human moving the
card around mid-flight cannot corrupt the state machine.
