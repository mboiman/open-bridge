"""The record layer — what the engine DID, and what it decided on.

One sticky comment per run, edited in place. Edits never re-notify; a new comment
mails every subscriber. That asymmetry — not volume — is the entire cost model, so
the table may grow as long as it likes and a second comment is a real expense.
The only discrete comment the engine authors is the round-scoped reject note, and
that one is NOT written here (see "Two streams" below).

WHAT THIS REFUSES TO SAY
------------------------
The record reports what the engine OBSERVED. Three things it cannot observe are
therefore absent rather than guessed:

  * the model — nothing pins `--model` and claude_runner spawns exactly
    ["claude", "-p", prompt]; the child resolves the CLI default and the parent
    never learns it;
  * the token count — hardcoded to 0 on both real paths, so `tokens: 0` would read
    as "this run was free";
  * TDD order — green at the end is not red-before-green, and it is not
    reconstructible afterwards.

`StageResult.tokens` sits in the scope of every hook here, one attribute access
away. Printing it is the easy, wrong thing, which is why a test pins its absence.
The `handler` column is cut for the same family of reason: it is config echo,
constant per stage — and it would put an absolute local path in a public comment.

TWO STREAMS, ONE ENGINE, AND WHY THE MARKER IS LOAD-BEARING
-----------------------------------------------------------
The engine authors two comment streams on the same issue:

  * the reject note  — `<!-- board-pilot:reject round=N -->`, discrete, one per
    round, read BACK and fed to an autonomous code writer as its own feedback;
  * the run record   — `<!-- board-pilot:run item=<id> -->`, sticky, edited, never
    read back for any decision.

An author filter cannot separate them: both ARE the engine. A record legitimately
QUOTES a round's reject note, and the read-back keeps the LAST match without a
break (gh_board.py:426-428) while gh returns comments chronologically — so a record
that parsed as a reject note would outrank the real note and steer the producer,
silently and order-dependently. parse_reject is anchored at byte 0, which beats the
quoting case structurally; this module's job is to never hand it a byte-0 match.
The marker is validated by running the real parser over the real rendered line
(`_validate_marker`) rather than by a lookalike check that could drift from it.
A probe proved the hazard is reachable from config alone: a `sticky_marker` that
closes its own comment and opens a decoy renders a valid round-1 reject note.

THE FORMAT IS A TEMPLATE, NOT A FORMAT STRING IN CODE
-----------------------------------------------------
`record.templates_dir` points at a directory of `*.md.tmpl` files. The defaults
shipped under `templates/` ARE the documented format — the same text this module
falls back to when the knob is unset, pinned byte-for-byte by
`test_default_templates_match_builtin_output`. Adjusting the format means editing a
tracked markdown file, not this module.

A template is a `str.format_map` format string. No Jinja, no eval, no loops: it
describes a shape, it is not a program. `{rows}` arrives pre-joined precisely
because "no loops" means the ENGINE iterates, never the template.

Two failure classes, deliberately split:

  * an UNKNOWN placeholder renders LITERALLY and can never raise — `SafeDict`
    returns a `_Literal` that survives every operation format_map can perform on a
    looked-up value (`{x!r}`, `{x:>10}`, `{x:d}`, `{x.y}`, `{x[0]}`). A typo must
    cost the run nothing;
  * a template that cannot render AT ALL — an unclosed brace, a positional field
    (`{}` / `{0}`, and there are no positional args), or a format spec no string can
    satisfy (`{took:.2f}`) — fails LOUD from `Recorder.__init__`, the same
    wiring-time posture as `_validate_marker`.

The load-time probe renders with STRING samples, and that is what makes the first
bullet a guarantee instead of a hope: every field this module substitutes is a `str`
on every path, so a template that renders with string samples at load cannot raise
on real values at render.
