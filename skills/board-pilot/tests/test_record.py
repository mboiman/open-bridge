"""V1 — the record layer: the sticky run record and what it refuses to claim.

Two properties carry real risk and are pinned here:

1. **The sticky marker must never be readable as a reject note.** The engine now
   authors TWO comment streams on the same issue. One of them (the reject note) is
   fed straight back to an autonomous code writer as its own feedback. An author
   filter cannot separate the streams — both ARE the engine — so the ONLY thing
   keeping the record out of the producer's ear is the marker grammar.
2. **The record must not invent attribution.** No model is pinned and none is
   captured (claude_runner spawns exactly ["claude", "-p", prompt]); tokens are
   hardcoded to 0. A record that prints either reads as measured when it is not.
3. **The documented knob must actually turn.** `record.templates_dir` is advertised
   as THE FORMAT. Section 6 asserts rendered OUTPUT changes, because a key that
   parses and stores while changing nothing is a lie told in a config table.
