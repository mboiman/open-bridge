"""The 5 record hooks in tick.py — and the one invariant that outranks the record.

THE HARDEST INVARIANT: a record write must never decide whether work advances.
Every hook fires AFTER its latch and goes through `emit_guarded`. Unguarded, a
raising hook lands in the dispatch loop's outer guard → `res.skipped` → the item
re-dispatches next poll WITHOUT rolling back the `set_pipeline` that already
landed. A permanently failing sink (a 403, a deleted issue) therefore re-runs the
most expensive stage on every poll forever, while reporting a successful advance
as a skip.

Every test here asserts the hook ACTUALLY FIRED (`recorder.calls`) before asserting
what survived it. Without that assert, each one would pass against an engine with no
hooks at all — proving nothing.
