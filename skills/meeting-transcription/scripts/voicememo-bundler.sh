#!/usr/bin/env bash
# voicememo-bundler.sh — capture-side watcher for the iPhone Voice Memos folder
# (synced to this Mac via iCloud). Watches the flat, non-recursive Recordings/
# folder for new *.m4a files and pushes eligible ones into the "voicememo"
# transcription context via debrief_sync.sh push (async — the transcript shows
# up later via a separate pull, not this script's concern).
#
# Sibling of transcribe-bundler.sh (same idioms: log() style, remote_up()
# reachability probe, idempotent-push marker, launchd WatchPaths debounce) —
# see that script + docs/transcription-worker.md for the wider pipeline.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# SAFETY — READ THIS BEFORE TOUCHING CUTOFF_DATE OR THE BASELINE FILE
# The Recordings folder holds ~15 YEARS of personal voice memos (oldest seen:
# 2011). Two INDEPENDENT gates must both agree a file is new before it is ever
# pushed to the transcription worker — either one alone skipping it is enough
# to exclude it, neither one is "the" authority on its own:
#
#   1. BASELINE — a plain list of every filename that already existed at
#      2026-08-13 (~/Library/Application Support/bridge-voicememo/baseline.txt,
#      one snapshot, taken once, never regenerated). Anything in that file is
#      pre-existing by definition, permanently, regardless of what its own
#      filename date says. This is the PRIMARY signal — chosen specifically to
#      avoid depending on Voice Memos' own iCloud folder-sync (unreliable
#      timing, encrypted folder names, and this script never writes to Apple's
#      database — see the folder note below).
#   2. CUTOFF_DATE — the 8-digit YYYYMMDD filename prefix, string-compared
#      against a hardcoded constant. Kept as a redundant second check even
#      though the baseline already covers this, in case the baseline file is
#      ever lost/corrupted/regenerated wrong — cheap insurance, not the
#      primary mechanism.
#
# No "first run vs. later runs" branch exists in either check, so there is no
# code path that treats an old file differently based on when the script
# happens to run. Getting this wrong means silently exfiltrating over a
# decade of private audio to a remote machine.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Filenames observed in the wild (both handled — see the match regex below):
#   "20260813 095714-70E08E4C.m4a"   date, space, time, dash, uuid, .m4a
#   "20260718 184700.m4a"            date, space, time, .m4a (no uuid)
# Date = chars 1-8 (YYYYMMDD), time = chars 10-15 (HHMMSS), a literal space
# between them. Only *.m4a is considered — .waveform sidecar files and the
# "Capture" subdirectory are ignored by construction (the glob below is a
# non-recursive *.m4a pattern, so it never matches either).
#
# This folder is Apple's — Voice Memos tracks its exact contents in its own
# CoreData/CloudKit-backed database. This script is READ-ONLY with respect to
# it: it never creates marker/sidecar files, renames, or moves anything
# inside Recordings/, and never writes to CloudRecordings.db (a write from
# outside Voice Memos' own code wouldn't go through Core Data's change-
# tracking, so — separately from any risk to the store itself — it likely
# wouldn't even sync anywhere, defeating the point). All state this script
# needs lives entirely outside that folder:
#   ~/Library/Application Support/bridge-voicememo/baseline.txt        (see SAFETY block)
#   ~/Library/Application Support/bridge-voicememo/pushed/<basename>.done  (already-pushed marker, one empty file per recording)
#
# Drop-in: ~/bin/voicememo-bundler.sh   Logs: ~/Library/Logs/voicememo-bundler.log
# Triggered by launchd WatchPath (com.bks.voicememo-bundler.plist).
#
# NOTE: this script runs on the capture machine (Michael's Mac, where the
# Voice Memos folder lives), but unlike transcribe-bundler.sh it is NOT
# fully decoupled from the Bridge repo: it calls back into it to invoke
# debrief_sync.sh, the repo-side half of the push contract, which has no
# standalone existence outside it. DEBRIEF_SYNC and the WORKER lookup below
# therefore assume this script runs from its own position inside a Bridge
# checkout, the same assumption debrief_sync.sh and add_context.sh already
# make about their own location: resolved from
# ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} at runtime, never a hardcoded path or hostname. A flat
# `cp` deploy away from the repo (see the plist's "Install" step below)
# breaks this; deploy via a symlink into the repo copy instead, or point the
# launchd job directly at the in-repo path.
