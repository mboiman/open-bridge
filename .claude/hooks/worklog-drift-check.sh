# worklog-drift-check.sh — Claude Code Stop hook
#
# Nudges Claude to log before ending the turn when the session made
# code/doc edits but work/log.md was not touched. Keeps the work-system
# as actual working memory instead of drift.
#
# Wired in the tracked .claude/settings.json (Stop hook):
#
#   {
#     "hooks": {
#       "Stop": [
#         {
#           "hooks": [
#             {"type": "command",
#              "command": "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/worklog-drift-check.sh"}
#           ]
#         }
#       ]
#     }
#   }
#
# Two gates: (1) code/doc changed but work/log.md not touched today; (2) a
# STATUS.md whose body asserts completion while its frontmatter status: is not
# done (zombie-claim drift). Either fires → block stop (exit 2).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — allow stop (no drift, or not applicable)
#   2 — block stop with reminder (Claude sees it in-band and adds a log entry)
