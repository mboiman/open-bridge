# Regression suite for workflow/workloads/_schema.yaml.
#
#   run.sh            the suite: every valid/ file must pass, every invalid/
#                     file must fail AND name the reason it was written for.
#   run.sh --mutate   the mutation battery: soften ONE rule in a scratch copy of
#                     the schema and prove that exactly ONE negative control
#                     goes hollow. A rule whose control stays red under its own
#                     softening was never being tested by that control.
#
# valid/   Real cases from a live inventory, plus generic coverage cases for
#            the branches the inventory happens not to use.
# invalid/ Negative controls; every one MUST fail, the reason is asserted
#            (a test that fails for the wrong reason proves nothing), and every
#            one MUST have a needle in the battery below (a control nobody
#            mutated is a control nobody proved).
#
# What round 4 changed about this: until then the controls covered only the
# FORBIDDING half of the kind rules. Eight requiring rules and four sub clauses
# of the allOf rule could be deleted outright without the green moving at all.
# The names promised one property and the bodies measured another. Each of
# those rules now has its own control and its own needle, and whatever is NOT
# fully covered is printed at the end of the run, so nobody reads the green as
# larger than it is.
#
# Round 5 added the CONTENTS. Until then the schema only guarded STRUCTURE:
# which keys exist, which trigger belongs to which kind, what shape a time
# takes. What stood INSIDE a field it never looked at. Four holes fell through
# there, and all four passed both gates: a plaintext address in the mandant
# field, a phone number in the person field, a secret in the clear in
# execution.env, and relative paths in command, interpreter and working_dir.
# The interpreter case is the most expensive one because it does not crash: a
# relative path is a different TCC client, so only the grant is missing, and
# the run looks like an empty inbox.
# Counter-check for each of the four: the control validates CLEAN against the
# schema as it stood before that round. None of the four is invented.
#
# Language: this suite is CORE, and so is the schema it guards. Until
# 2026-08-27 this header said the opposite, that the controls were user tier
# and could stay in another language. The scope router had said `user` for this
# whole directory, which was a defect rather than a decision: the CI job that
# runs this file promotes, so the suite had to travel with it or the upstream
# would call a file that never arrived. A fixture depicts a declaration, and
# the `scope:` inside one describes what it depicts, never where it lives.
#
# The field separator in both tables is "@@" and not "|": the patterns in the
# schema contain alternations, and a "|" in there would have cut the table in
# half without a sound.
#
# The working tree is never modified, not even by --mutate.

Coverage, named honestly:

  Its own control AND its own needle, per rule:
    kind rules, the forbidding and the requiring half
    allOf for bridge owned runs, all four sub clauses plus the deadline
    runtime external means owner foreign
    instant patterns at, provisioned_at, retired.at
    timezone: the Region/Place form, and the offset in IANA spelling
    retired.required, recipients[].required
    content: mandant and person as slugs, env value as a reference, env name
    paths: interpreter, working_dir, command[0]
    the program keeps its name: no version in the interpreter path, and a
      declared privacy grant needs a client path of its own

  Checked REPRESENTATIVELY only. One control stands for a whole class; remove
  another instance of the same class from the schema and you will NOT notice
  it HERE:
    required lists ........ all 5 lists have a control, but only one key per
                            list: placement (1 of 5 at the top), owner (1 of 4),
                            reason (1 of 2), mandant (1 of 1), interpreter
                            (1 of 1, the conditional list under allOf)
    additionalProperties .. 2 of 8 places: the top level and recipients[].
                            placement, schedule, execution, response, reconcile
                            and retired are unguarded
    enum .................. 3 of 10 fields: owner, privacy_grants and the deny
                            list of shared interpreters. scope, kind, runtime,
                            evidence, isolation, on_timeout and notify_on are
                            not
    pattern ............... 14 of 16 places. Exactly two stay unguarded:
                            id and delivery_at
    minimum ............... 1 of 4: timeout_sec. port, every_sec and
                            duration_estimate_min are not
    minItems .............. 1 of 2: command, not watch_paths
    minLength ............. 1 of 2: purpose, not retired.reason
    type and const ........ not at all, schema_version: const 1 included

  Content safety, and where it ends. The four content rules check FORM and not
  meaning, and none of them guesses what a secret is:
    env ................... a value is refused BECAUSE it is a value, not
                            because it looks like a key. A secret typed as a
                            LOCATOR (keychain:// followed by the key itself) is
                            well formed and passes. The form cannot see that.
    free text ............. command arguments, reconcile.probe, purpose,
                            learned_from and title stay unguarded. A secret in
                            argv lands in the unit file just as one in env does.
    command ............... only argv[0] is forced to be absolute. What follows
                            are flags and values, and a rule about those would
                            be a guess.
    existence ............. no pattern checks WHETHER the mandant, the person,
                            the entry in the store or the path exists. Only a
                            read of the respective source can do that, and the
                            declaration gate is there for it, not this file.
    the second gate ....... caught up (integration pass, round 4). The hand
                            written gate in engine/model.py now carries all four
                            rules itself, character for character with the
                            schema and without reading it; the class
                            TheHandWrittenGateHoldsWhatTheSchemaHolds measures
                            them together with their counter controls, and
                            test_the_two_gates_hold_the_same_rules_word_for_word
                            compares the six shared patterns directly against
                            this file. That is the point of the duplication: the
                            gate that answers the acting layer (provision.plan
                            calls model.validate, never the schema) holds the
                            same rule on a machine without check-jsonschema too.

  Why not all of them: a second control of the same keyword class proves the
  same behaviour on a different field and costs one uniquely addressable line in
  the schema per rule. The representatives are chosen rather than left over:
  what is checked is the instance whose silent failure would be the most
  expensive. The heaviest single case therefore stands above and not down here,
  namely additionalProperties at the top level, which keeps `status:` out.
