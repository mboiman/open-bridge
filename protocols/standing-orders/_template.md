# Order Title

<!-- Keep `load: eager` ONLY when the order bites while nobody says its own
     vocabulary (a logging duty, a security floor). Everything else is
     on-trigger: the summary above stays in context, the body arrives when the
     trigger lands. Validate with `python3 scripts/standing-orders.py --check`. -->
