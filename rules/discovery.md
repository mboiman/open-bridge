# Discovery — Config-Type Resolution Helper

Bridge follows the Default-to-Folder rule: every config type lives in
`<wrapper>/<types>/`. Skills that need "all mandants" or "all personas"
call `discover()` and get the instances back as a sorted list of paths.
Templates and schemas (`_` prefix) are excluded.

## Config authoring — declare capabilities, not consumers

Discovery only works one direction: a **provider declares WHAT it offers**, a
**skill discovers WHO offers what it needs** — never the reverse. A config
file must never carry a `consumers:` list that names the specific skills using
it.

**The gate** — before adding any config section that more than one skill reads:

1. **Provider declares `provides:`** — a capability list (`provides: [chat,
   calls, calendar, ...]`), describing WHAT it delivers, not WHO consumes it.
2. **Skill discovers by capability** — it asks "who provides capability X?",
   never "who listed me as a consumer?". Same `discover()` direction as the
   contract below.
3. **Skill-specific tuning stays out of the provider block** — `window_min`,
   `formats`, filters live in the skill workflow or namespaced under
   `<skill>.<key>`, never nested inside the provider's section.

**Why** — a `consumers: [briefing, debrief]` field forces every provider
author to know its consumers in advance and every skill author to patch all
provider configs on adoption: bidirectional coupling. Capability-based
discovery scales O(1) both ways — other Bridge instances (open-bridge OSS,
org overlays, third-party) add a provider without touching skill code, and
add a skill without patching existing configs.

**Litmus:** can a new provider be added without changing skill code, and a
new skill consume without patching provider configs? If either is no,
restructure. Reference shape: `integrations.context_sources.{name}.provides: [...]`
in `bridge-config.yaml` — same logic governs `trackers/{name}.md` playbooks
and channel definitions.

## Contract

```python
def discover(type_singular: str, repo_root: Path | None = None) -> list[Path]:
    """
    Resolve all instances of a config type.

    Parameters:
      type_singular: type name in singular form (e.g. "persona", "mandant", "remote")
      repo_root:     optional. Defaults to env var BRIDGE_ROOT, then cwd.

    Returns:
      sorted list of yaml file Paths matching the type. Excludes _-prefixed
      files (templates, schemas, state).

    Caveats: see § Plural caveat and § Behavior below.
    """
    root = Path(repo_root or os.environ.get("BRIDGE_ROOT") or Path.cwd())
    for wrapper in ["identity", "infra", "workflow"]:
        folder = root / wrapper / f"{type_singular}s"
        if folder.is_dir():
            return sorted(f for f in folder.glob("*.yaml") if not f.name.startswith("_"))
    return []
```

## Behavior

Per type, `discover()` checks in order:
1. Does the `<wrapper>/<type>s/` folder exist? → take the `*.yaml` files inside (except `_*`-prefixed).
2. Otherwise: empty list (the folder must exist — if it doesn't, the type is not set up).

Wrapper order: `identity` → `infra` → `workflow`. First non-empty match set wins.

## Example calls

```python
discover('persona')   # ['identity/personas/alice-work.yaml', ...]
discover('account')   # ['identity/accounts/alice-personal.yaml', ...]
discover('mandant')   # ['identity/mandants/acme.yaml', ...]
discover('remote')    # ['infra/remotes/workstation.yaml', ...]
discover('channel')   # ['infra/channels/imessage.yaml', ...]
discover('backup')    # ['infra/backups/topology.yaml']  (Singleton)
discover('calendar')  # ['workflow/calendars/entries.yaml']  (Singleton)
discover('context')   # ['workflow/contexts/doc-system.yaml']
discover('project')   # ['workflow/projects/customer-x.yaml', ...]
```

## Implementation note

No shared Python package today — skills inline the code or use `find`/`ls`
from Bash. Extract to `scripts/discover.py` or `skills/_shared/discover.py`
once multiple skills replicate the logic.

## Plural caveat

`<singular> + s` works for **all current types**:
persona/personas, account/accounts, mandant/mandants, remote/remotes,
channel/channels, backup/backups, calendar/calendars, context/contexts,
project/projects.

A hypothetical type with an irregular plural (e.g. "index" → "indices")
would require the helper to map manually. No need today — type names are
chosen to be regular.

## Singletons

Some types have exactly one instance today (calendar as master list,
backup topology). They still live in the plural folder; the filename
describes the content:

- `workflow/calendars/entries.yaml`  — all calendar entries
- `infra/backups/topology.yaml`      — source × target × pipeline definitions

If the type becomes multi-file later, additional files go alongside — no
layout change needed.
