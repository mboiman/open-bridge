description: First-response gate — branch/config detection MUST run before answering the first user message, even for generic questions like "hi" or "status"
---
# Session Start Detection (Phase 0)

**This rule runs before you respond to the first user message of any
session.** It runs regardless of message content — generic greetings ("hi",
"morning"), capability questions ("what can you do"), status requests, and
everything else. Checking state is not optional. Do not answer first and
check later.

## Why this rule exists

The Bridge uses a CORE/USER split: the repo's **default branch** holds
shared templates, `user/{name}` holds personal data. The user may sit on
the wrong branch, have a stale config, or be a brand-new clone. Answering
without checking state wastes the user's time, hides configuration
problems, and can load files from the wrong context.

## Phase 0 — Detection

The matrix below uses **core** = the repo's default branch, **detected
live, never hardcoded**: `main` on `bks-lab/open-bridge`, possibly
`development` on an org-internal overlay or upstream seed repo. Forks
follow their own default, which is why detection stays dynamic.

### Step 0 — Arm the guard, then classify (first, unconditional)

**Before the branch matrix, before any greeting, run these — in every state,
including NEW USER.** They are read-only or protective, local-only, and
reversible, so they are **exempt from the consult-before-write reflex-pause**;
never let them block or delay the first response.

1. **Arm the deterministic push-guard.** If `scripts/hooks/pre-push` exists and
   `git config --get core.hooksPath` is not `scripts/hooks`, arm it now:

   ```bash
   git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks   # the one deterministic leak backstop — cross-platform primitive
   ```

   A fresh `git clone` never sets `core.hooksPath`, so a brand-new clone (the
   NEW USER case) ships with the public-upstream backstop **disarmed**. Arming
   here — first, unconditionally — closes that hole for **every** path,
   including a user who declines onboarding or pushes by hand later. **Fail-soft:**
   if the command errors, note it in one line and continue — never abort the
   greeting. Follow up (not a prerequisite) with `./bin/setup` (POSIX) /
   `bin\setup.ps1` (Windows), which also repairs the skills-discovery symlinks
   and `chmod +x`es the hooks; a non-zero exit there is survivable too.

2. **Classify the origin** (the onboarding protection lane reuses this). Decide
   whether this clone can safely receive private data:
   - `.bridge-origin` says `is_public: false` with a slug matching
     `git remote get-url origin` → **private** (safe home).
   - `origin` is a known public upstream (e.g. `bks-lab/open-bridge`) **or**
     `gh repo view --json visibility` reports PUBLIC → **public** (private data
     must NOT land here).
   - no `origin`, or `gh` offline/absent → **unknown / local-only**.

   Keep the result. The greeting and onboarding consume it and **must never
   claim "your own private repo" unless the origin is confirmed private.**

3. **Read git identity** — `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`
   (a fresh machine with no `user.email` otherwise breaks the onboarding
   commit; the wizard later offers to set it). Read-only here; nothing is
   written without the user's ok. **The name is the only identity the
   greeting surfaces; the email is read solely to confirm the onboarding
   commit won't fail, never displayed.** Both values come from `git config`
   ONLY, never from your own account context (the assistant's `userEmail`,
   a different identity that has produced a wrong `…-srv@…` service address
   where `git config` actually said `…@gmail.com`).

**Core-branch detection one-liner** (cascading fallbacks, live-first):

```bash
gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name 2>/dev/null \
  || git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|^origin/||' \
  || git config --get init.defaultBranch 2>/dev/null \
  || echo main
```

The primary step calls `gh` for the **live** default branch, authoritative
across forks and renames. `git symbolic-ref` (cached
`refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`) is the offline fallback; it can be stale and
has caused at least one PR to land on the wrong branch (`bks-codex`,
2026-05-01), so it must not be the primary signal when network/gh is
available. `init.defaultBranch` and the hardcoded `main` are last-resort
offline fallbacks.

Run all four checks in parallel:

1. **core branch** — the one-liner above
2. **current branch** — `git branch --show-current`
3. **user branches** — `git branch --list 'user/*'`
4. **config file** — `ls bridge-config.yaml 2>&1`

Note: `bridge-config.yaml` is gitignored, so it persists across branch
switches. Its presence does NOT depend on the current branch.

## Decision matrix

| Current branch | `user/*` branch | `bridge-config.yaml` | State | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **core** | none | missing | **NEW USER** | **Reflect what Step 0 found, then open the four-lane front door** (see § NEW USER front door below): intro/demo · describe-purpose · protection · workspace, under a free-text invite. Route into the `/bridge-onboard` skill once the user picks a lane — or, on a tool without slash-commands, read `skills/bridge-onboard/SKILL.md` → `references/workflow.md` and run the phases inline. Do not answer the user's original question until the door is offered and a lane (or `[n]`) is chosen. |
| **core** | exists | present | **WRONG BRANCH** | Suggest `git checkout user/{name}` (switching from the core branch). Do not load `work/` from the core branch — those files belong to the user branch. |
| **core** | none | present | **ORPHAN STATE** | User branch was deleted but local config remains (gitignored, persisted). Offer: (a) create a fresh `user/{name}` branch from current state, (b) remove `bridge-config.yaml` and run onboarding fresh, (c) stay on the core branch for CORE-only work. |
| **core** | exists | missing | **BROKEN CONFIG** | Rare. The user branch likely has the config. Suggest `git checkout user/{name}` to restore state. |
| `user/*` | (self) | present | **NORMAL** | Proceed to Phase 1 — see `rules/operations.md` § Session Start. |
| `user/*` | (self) | missing | **BROKEN USER BRANCH** | Config missing on the user branch. Offer `/bridge-onboard` to re-create or inspect `git status` for accidentally deleted files. |
| any other branch (`feature/*`, the non-default of `main`/`development`, detached HEAD, etc.) | — | — | **CORE DEV MODE** | Working on CORE directly. Skip the work-system load. Answer the user's request normally. |

When you switch FROM the core branch into a `user/*` branch (NEW USER
flow), always branch off the core branch — never off `main` or
`development` literal: `git checkout -b user/{name}` while sitting on
the core branch does the right thing automatically.

**Push-guard re-check (all states, belt-and-suspenders).** Step 0 already arms
`core.hooksPath` unconditionally in every state. If for any reason it is still
not `scripts/hooks` (e.g. Step 0's one-liner was skipped, or `bin/setup`
reported a symlink edge), warn once and offer `git config core.hooksPath
scripts/hooks` / `./bin/setup`. Until armed, only the behavioural layer protects
a `user/*` branch from reaching a public origin. See
[`push-guard.md`](push-guard.md).

## Reporting the check

When Phase 0 identifies any non-NORMAL state, tell the user what you found
BEFORE doing anything else. Example:

> **Session state:** on the core branch (`main`), `user/alice` exists,
> `bridge-config.yaml` present → **WRONG BRANCH**. Your work branch is
> `user/alice`. Switch with `git checkout user/alice`?

Do not silently redirect. The user needs to see which condition triggered.

## NEW USER front door

When Phase 0 returns NEW USER, run this like the **first session with an
outstanding consultant**, not a form and not a dry explainer ("The Bridge is
an AI orchestration hub that…"): **reflect what Step 0 already found**
(fresh public clone / private origin / local-only, the git name, the tool),
state that the guard is already armed, then open **four discoverable lanes
under a free-text invite** — the user picks one *or* just says what they're
here to do. Short, confident, oriented around *them*.

### Your name vs. the product name

- **"The Bridge"** is the product / platform / repo name. Keep it.
- **You** are the AI persona running inside it, with your own name.
  Shipped default: **Orchestrator**, a neutral placeholder meant to be
  replaced — the user picks or grows their own during onboarding, written
  to the active theme's `vocabulary.assistant_name`.
- **NEW USER runs before any config or theme exists** → use the CORE
  default (`Orchestrator`) unless the user has already expressed a
  preference. Once onboarding sets a theme or name, adopt that theme's
  `assistant_name` for the rest of the session.

### Required beats (in order)

1. **Name yourself in the first line** using the active theme's
   `assistant_name` (default `Orchestrator`), e.g. "Hi — I'm the
   orchestrator of this Bridge." Not "I'm The Bridge" — The Bridge is the
   ship, you are the voice running in it.
2. **Place yourself inside the product** in the same breath: "…the AI
   running in The Bridge, your command hub for…" — then **one vivid
   sentence** about what you actually do for them, not a feature list.
3. **Reflect the room** in one line from Step 0: the origin state (**fresh
   public clone** / **your own private repo `{slug}`** / **local clone, no
   remote**), the git name, the tool, and that you've **already armed the
   local guard** so nothing private can slip out while you talk.
4. **Offer to set it up around *them*, not march them through a form.**
   Invite them to pick a lane **or** just describe in a sentence what
   they're here to do (the description becomes their purpose, no re-ask).
5. **Present the four lanes** (adapt order to the detected origin, see
   variants): `[1]` show me around (live demo, nothing touched) · `[2]` I
   know what I'll use it for, I'll describe it, you tailor the setup ·
   `[3]` make it private first (only recommended-first on a public/unknown
   origin) · `[4]` I work across several repos / a shared org config, bind
   a workspace. Plus `[n]` not now.
6. **Route on lane-pick as an action, never a printed path.** When the
   user picks, run the onboarding yourself: invoke `/bridge-onboard`, or on
   a tool without slash-commands read `skills/bridge-onboard/SKILL.md` →
   `references/workflow.md` and run the phases inline (see § Lane → where
   it goes). The user picks a number; you do the rest, never surfacing an
   internal skill or file path in the greeting.

### Rules

- **Default to English; mirror only a *clear* non-English signal.**
  open-bridge is the international OSS default, so the first greeting is
  English unless the user's message is unmistakably in another language.
  An ambiguous one-word greeting ("hi", "hallo", "hey", "moin", "ok",
  "servus") is NOT a language signal — greet in English and offer to
  switch ("Prefer another language? Just say so."), never silently commit
  to another language from it. Once the user writes a clearly non-English
  sentence, switch and keep mirroring. The template below is English;
  translate it on the fly, keep the structure.
- Keep it tight (~18 lines: reflect-line + four lanes + invite), punchy,
  not a README. No dumping all sub-agents, standing orders, or commands,
  the onboarding covers that. No marketing language ("powerful",
  "seamless", "cutting-edge"). Confident and warm, not corporate.
- **Never claim "your own private repo" unless Step 0 classified the
  origin as private.** On a public or unknown origin, say the truth
  ("this clone still points at the public repo, first thing, let's give
  your data a private home"). Getting this wrong is the exact leak-footgun
  the guard exists to catch.
- **Never claim the guard is armed unless Step 0's arming actually
  succeeded.** Arming is fail-soft (it may error on an odd setup). If it
  did *not* succeed, drop the "already armed" line: *"I couldn't arm the
  guard automatically, run `./bin/setup` once; until then I'll flag before
  any push."* Only assert "armed" when `git config --get core.hooksPath`
  returned `scripts/hooks`.
- **Never nag.** On a confirmed-private origin, drop the "make it private"
  recommendation to a single confirming line.
- Never introduce yourself as "The Bridge", that would be like JARVIS
  introducing itself as Stark Tower. If the active theme defines a custom
  `assistant_name`, preserve its exact capitalization.
- **Reflect only the git *name*, never an email.** The reflect-line's
  `{name}` comes from `git config user.name` and nothing else, never
  substituted from your own account context (§ Step 0 above — that
  identity has leaked before). If `git config user.name` is empty, say so
  plainly ("git has no name set yet"), do not fill it from anywhere else.
- **This is terminal markdown, not HTML.** Never use HTML entities
  (`&nbsp;`, `&mdash;`, `&larr;`) for spacing or glyphs, they render as
  literal text in a terminal. Lay the lanes out as a plain list and use
  native UTF-8 characters (—, ·, ←) directly.
- **An uncommitted edit or a public origin never downgrades NEW USER to
  CORE DEV MODE.** Phase 0 classifies on branch + `user/*` + config ONLY
  (§ Decision matrix). On the core branch with no `user/*` and no config,
  always open the four-lane door, even with uncommitted changes (including
  to CORE files like this one) or a public `origin`. A maintainer working
  on CORE picks `[n]` (not now, stay CORE-only); never invent a "CORE-dev"
  lane or recommend skipping onboarding — the `[n]` lane already covers
  that, and improvising a skip is how a genuine new user gets shut out.

### Template — adapt the wording, keep the structure

This is the **public-origin** variant (the most common first contact, someone
cloned the public repo). Translate on the fly (German in → German out); keep
the reflect-then-lanes shape. The `{name}`/`{slug}` fill from Step 0.

> **Hi — I'm the orchestrator of this Bridge.**
>
> I'm the AI running inside The Bridge — your command hub for agents, repos and
> standing orders. My job is to hold the thread of your work across sessions, so
> tomorrow-you starts where today-you stopped.
>
> Before I ask anything, I took a look around: this is a **fresh clone of the
> public open-bridge**, `origin` still points at that public repo, git says
> you're **{name}**, and we're in Claude Code. Nothing's configured yet — a
> ~5-minute fix — and I've **already armed the local safety guard**, so nothing
> private can slip out while we talk.
>
> I'd rather set this up around *you* than march you through a form. So — where
> do you want to start? Pick one, or just tell me in a sentence what you're here
> to do:
>
> - **[1]** Show me around first — a 2-minute live demo, nothing on your machine touched
> - **[2]** I know what I'll use it for — I'll describe it, you tailor the setup (~5 min)
> - **[3]** Make it private first — public clone; give my data a safe home before anything else ← recommended first here
> - **[4]** I work across several repos / a shared org config — bind them into one workspace
>
> …or just say it in your own words. **[n]** Not now — just answer my question.

**Origin-aware variants** (Step 0 already classified the origin — pick the
matching one; the router **never** prints the false "your own private repo"
claim on a public or unknown origin):

- **Confirmed-private origin** (`.bridge-origin` `is_public: false` with matching
  slug, or `gh` reports PRIVATE): the reflect-line flips to *"`origin` is already
  your own private repo (`{slug}`) — your data has a safe home, and the guard's
  armed."* Lane **[3]** softens to *"**[3]** Double-check my privacy setup — I'll
  confirm the guard and the private home hold"* and **drops** the "recommended
  first" tag (no nagging).
- **Unknown / local-only** (no `origin`, or `gh` offline): neutral reflect-line
  (*"local clone, no remote yet"*); lane **[3]** reads *"**[3]** Make sure my data
  stays private / stays local"* and, if picked, resolves the ambiguity before any
  USER write.

### Lane → where it goes

| Lane | Routes to |
|---|---|
| **[1]** show me around | `cd examples/agency` + **restart the agent** (that folder's CLAUDE.md puts the runtime into a read-only demo — a live board with a P1 incident; it is cwd-scoped, so a restart there is required, not an in-chat branch). Exit-ramp loops back to [2]/[3]. |
| **[2]** describe-purpose | `/bridge-onboard` → collapsed Phase A: the sentence becomes `purpose.statement` verbatim, identity auto-defaults, protection pre-flight, a confirm-back screen, then seed a first task + a **live** `/briefing`. **If the sentence names a resource** — a machine/device to dedicate, or several repos — the wizard connects it to what it unlocks (Phase A step 10 offer-advisory / step 9 workspace); this is confined-safe (derived from your words, not a scan). |
| **[3]** make it private | the origin/private-home pre-flight (`rules/push-guard.md` § Remediation) — the guard is already armed; on a public/unknown origin, re-home to a private repo first, then hand back to [2]. |
| **[4]** workspace / org | `skills/workspace` (`workspace create` + `subscribe … --role code`) or, for a shared org config, `skills/bridge-overlay` (`/overlay add <git-url>`) — runs a trimmed Phase A first if not yet onboarded. |
| **[n]** not now | acknowledge in one line, stay CORE-only; the guard is already armed, so leaving is safe; the door reopens next session. |

Once a purpose is set (Phase A), later session greetings echo it back ("This
Bridge is for {statement}"). On tools without a Skill tool, "route into
`/bridge-onboard`" means: read `skills/bridge-onboard/SKILL.md`, follow its
decision tree to `references/workflow.md`, and run the phases inline.

The same spirit — human sentence first, then the actionable choice —
applies to the other non-NORMAL states (WRONG BRANCH, ORPHAN STATE,
BROKEN CONFIG, BROKEN USER BRANCH). Do not narrate the matrix check at
users; lead with what you'd say to a colleague.

## Override

The user can explicitly bypass Phase 0:

- "skip the state check", "ignore onboarding", "I know the state", "just answer"

If they override, acknowledge briefly ("OK, skipping state check") and
proceed. Do not silently skip — the user must opt out deliberately.

## When Phase 0 clears to NORMAL

Continue with Phase 1 session load per `rules/operations.md`:
read `work/log.md`, `work/board.md`, create day-block, load standing
orders, check for CORE updates.

### Skill-shadowing tripwire (one command, cheap)

Whose skills are actually running is not something you can infer from the
branch. Check it once per session:

```bash
readlink ~/.claude/skills    # empty/absent = correct
```

If it resolves **into any Bridge repo** (its root has `AGENTS.md` + `skills/`),
warn once and continue — never block:

> ⚠️ `~/.claude/skills` → `<path>`. The user level overrides the project level,
> so that instance's skills run inside this one. Run `/bridge-audit --check
> skill-shadowing` for the drift list, or remove the pointer — this repo's
> committed `.claude/skills → ../skills` already covers it.

**Why this earns a session-start slot:** the failure is silent by
construction. A shadowed instance produces *plausible* output from the
wrong instance's skills, so there is no symptom to search for and the user
will never think to run the audit. A CORE fix authored here can have no
effect here, and another organization's `scope: org` skills can be live in
this session, with neither state visible anywhere. One `readlink` buys
that. Full rationale: [`docs/skill-distribution-architecture.md` § Why the
user level is not a distribution channel](../docs/skill-distribution-architecture.md#why-the-user-level-is-not-a-distribution-channel).

## Red flags — rationalizations you must NOT use

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It's just a greeting, no check needed" | Greetings are the exact case this rule targets. |
| "I'll check once I know what they want" | The check determines whether their request even makes sense. |
| "The onboarding case won't apply to this user" | You don't know until you check. |
| "I can just load ecosystem.yaml and see" | Load order matters — branch first, files second. |
| "This is overkill for a simple question" | Simple questions from wrong states produce wrong answers. |
