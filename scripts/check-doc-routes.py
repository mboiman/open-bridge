"""Every path an always-on document names must resolve.

Trimming an always-on file works by replacing an explanation with a pointer to
the file that owns it. That trade is only sound while the pointer resolves. A
pointer at a file that was renamed, or never existed, is strictly worse than the
paragraph it replaced: the paragraph was at least readable, and a dead pointer
fails silently, at the moment somebody needed the thing it pointed at.

A load-bearing pointer is therefore written as a markdown link, and a link is
what this checks. A backticked path stays prose.

    python3 scripts/check-doc-routes.py

Exit 0 when every route resolves, 1 otherwise.

The contract lives in `scripts/tests/test_doc_routes.py`.
