"""Measure the always-on context a session loads, and hold it to a declared cap.

Every session loads a fixed body of text before the first answer: the
`@`-imports named in CLAUDE.md, the standing orders carrying `scope: always`,
and the Phase 1 reads. Nothing measured it, so it only ever grew, and it grew
where nobody looks: roughly half arrives through tool reads rather than
imports, so it never appears in a client's context listing at all.

One file in this repo has never sprawled, `identity/agent/SOUL.md`, and the
only thing that distinguishes it is a declared cap that a validator enforces.
This script generalises that cap to the whole always-on surface.

    python3 scripts/measure-context.py                 # report + gate
    python3 scripts/measure-context.py --method api    # exact counts
    python3 scripts/measure-context.py --out FILE      # also write the report

Exit code 0 when every item is within policy, 1 otherwise.

WHAT GATES AND WHAT ONLY INFORMS. The gate is on **bytes**, which are exact,
offline, and identical on every machine. Tokens are reported beside them, and
carry the method that produced them: `api` is exact
(`messages.count_tokens`, model-specific), `bytes` is an estimate from a
declared calibration. An estimate never fails a build, and never wears the
label of an exact count. A budget figure that does not say what counted it is
not a measurement.

The full contract, including every state and why it exists, lives in
`scripts/tests/test_measure_context.py`, which is the spec for this file.
