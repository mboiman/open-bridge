"""Export a Bridge instance as an Open Knowledge Format (OKF) v0.2 bundle.

A single, additive, dependency-free script that walks a Bridge instance's
knowledge surfaces (work/ STATUS.md + deliverables, docs/, rules/,
examples/) and emits a static OKF bundle — one markdown file per concept, a
per-type index.md, and a root index.md carrying the OKF version. No PyYAML
dependency: frontmatter parsing is hand-rolled. It keeps
scripts/extract-frontmatter.py's leading-comment-prolog convention (skips the
`# yaml-language-server: $schema=...` hint) and reads the same flat
`key: value` scalars scripts/gen-board.py's parse_status() reads, but it
deliberately diverges from that script on two points, because gen-board.py is
lenient where YAML is not:

  * quoting is resolved BEFORE inline comments, the order YAML itself uses, so
    a `#` inside a quoted scalar stays a literal character (`"... as PR #214"`
    keeps its issue number). On an UNQUOTED scalar a ` #` after a space or a
    tab still opens a comment and is still stripped. A quote closes a quoted
    scalar only where a quote may close one (nothing behind it, or a
    comment); anywhere else it was a character in the value, and the value
    degrades to the plain path rather than being cut there. A value that does
    NOT open with a quote is a plain scalar and keeps every character
    including its last, so `monitor is 12"` and `The so-called "bridge"`
    survive; only an orphaned outer PAIR is stripped off a quoted scalar
    whose closing quote could not be found.
  * the OPENING `---` fence is only a fence at COLUMN 0. The CLOSING one is
    judged by block-scalar state: an indented `---` inside an open block
    scalar is content (that is what a block-scalar continuation line looks
    like), and an indented `---` anywhere else still closes, because holding
    the closer to column 0 unconditionally eats the body of every file that
    merely indents its fence.

Measured rather than asserted: over 21,144 well-formed frontmatter lines
(every value spelled plain, double quoted and single quoted, each line
accepted by PyYAML), this parser now agrees with PyYAML on all of them.

Concept mapping (source -> OKF `type`):
  work/tasks/<slug>/STATUS.md          -> task
  work/streams/<slug>/STATUS.md        -> stream
  work/done/<month>/<slug>/STATUS.md   -> task
  */deliverables/*.md under work/      -> deliverable
  docs/**/*.md                         -> doc
  rules/**/*.md                        -> rule
  examples/**/*.md                     -> example
  <memory-dir>/*.md fact files         -> memory   (user scope only)

Memory facts are the instance's auto-memory files (frontmatter with a
`name:` key); the directory usually lives OUTSIDE the repo and defaults to
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-root>/memory` (override with --memory-dir).
Every concept carries a `resource:` field pointing at its source (repo-
relative path, or `memory/<filename>` for memory facts).

What v0.2 emits, and what it deliberately does not:

  generated.by   the actor that produced this BUNDLE DOCUMENT — by default
                 `okf-export/<EXPORTER_VERSION>`, overridable with
                 --generated-by. It never claims to be the author of the
                 underlying knowledge; `resource` is the provenance pointer.
  generated.at   the source's `last_updated`/`created`, normalized to an ISO
                 instant. A date that cannot be proven (partial, the literal
                 `YYYY-MM-DD` template placeholder, calendar-impossible) is
                 OMITTED rather than guessed.
  bridge_status  the source's Bridge workflow state, under a namespaced key.
                 It is NEVER written to OKF's own `status`: that field means
                 document readiness (draft|stable|deprecated) while a Bridge
                 status means work state (backlog|doing|review|done), and
                 `draft` is a homograph across the two. Absent `status`
                 already means `stable`, which is the true claim here.
  timestamp      REMOVED in v0.2 (superseded by generated.at). Not dual-emitted:
                 the spec's legacy fallback applies only when `generated` is
                 absent, which it never is.
  verified /     never emitted. Nothing in a Bridge instance is a verification
  sources /      event, a derivation edge, or an expiry instant, and all three
  stale_after    drive consumer behaviour (trust tiers, credibility
                 propagation, staleness gating) — so a fabricated value does
                 not read as noise, it reads as a false claim.

Empty optional fields are omitted, never written as "" or []: absence
carries meaning in OKF, so an empty value is a different claim from
"not recorded".

Every index file lists exactly as many entries as it has things to list, one
per line, and every entry's link points at that entry's own concept file. A
per-type index.md is the only generated file that puts source text into
markdown, and THREE of its values are source-derived: the title, the
description and the slug, which is a source FILENAME. The two text fields are
rendered as inline TEXT rather than markup (control characters, every line
break included, become spaces; `[`, `]`, backslash and `<` are escaped) and the
slug is percent-encoded into a relative URL. Otherwise a newline in any of
the three splits its own bullet and the overflow reads as an entry the count
above it does not admit; an unescaped closing bracket hands the parentheses
behind it to the source as a link destination; raw inline HTML opens list
items of its own; and a filename holding a space or a `)` leaves the entry
with no usable link at all. See _md_inline and _md_destination.

Wikilinks (kebab-case `[[slug]]` only — bash `[[ -f ... ]]` conditionals
never match) are resolved at export time against the bundle's own slug
index — never rewritten in the source repo. A resolved link becomes a
bundle-root-relative markdown link (`[slug](/<type>/<slug>.md)`, memory
concepts win cross-type slug collisions); an unresolved `[[slug]]` is left
completely untouched (OKF tolerates dangling references) and is reported
back in the manifest.

Scope controls which sources are walked:
  --scope user   everything (work/ + docs/ + rules/ + examples/ + memory)
                 — private, full-instance export.
  --scope core   docs/ + examples/ only — the public-safe subset for a demo
                 export (e.g. docs/ + examples/agency/). Run
                 scripts/no-scrub-leak.py over the output before publishing
                 a core-scope bundle.

--out must lie OUTSIDE every directory ANY scope walks, and outside the memory
dir, in EVERY scope. A bundle written inside a scanned directory is read back
in as source material on the next run, so the concept count climbs on every
run and the byte-identical re-run guarantee is false; the destination is
therefore refused before the walk and before anything is cleared. The scanned
set is derived from the same per-scope pattern list discover_sources globs
(_SCOPE_PATTERNS), so it can never drift out of step with what is actually
read: each pattern contributes its fixed prefix (which covers a directory that
does not exist yet) and the resolved result of running the walk's own glob
over the pattern's parent (which covers a directory reached through a symlink
at a literal segment after the globbed part). The guard takes the UNION over
the scopes rather than the running one, and the memory clause applies in every
scope for the same reason: the bundle stays on disk for the next run whichever
scope that is. Comparison is segment-wise on resolved paths in the
filesystem's own case-folded namespace, so a symlink, a `..` segment or a
different letter case cannot slip past it; on a case-SENSITIVE filesystem that
also refuses a pair that really is two directories, which the refusal says.
dist/okf-bundle is outside the scanned set in every scope.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/okf-export.py --out dist/okf-bundle
  python3 scripts/okf-export.py --root . --out dist/okf-bundle --scope core
  python3 scripts/okf-export.py --out dist/okf-bundle --generated-by human:alice

Exit codes:
  0   bundle written successfully
  1   --root does not exist / is not a directory, unsafe --out refused, a
      concept cannot be written, or --generated-by is not a valid OKF actor.
      An --out is unsafe when it exists and is not a directory, when it is
      --root or an ancestor of it, when it sits inside a scanned directory or
      contains one, when it overlaps the memory dir (in either scope), or when
      it is a non-empty directory that does not look like a prior bundle. A
      concept cannot be written when two of one type name a single file, or
      when a slug is longer than the filesystem's filename limit. Every one of
      those is checked before the destination is cleared, so a refused run
      leaves the sources and any previous bundle untouched.

    A slug becomes a filename, so the namespace that has to stay unique is

    NTFS compare filenames case-insensitively, and APFS additionally reads
    the NFC and NFD spellings of one character as the same name while
    preserving whichever bytes were written. So `readme` and `README`, and
    the two spellings of `café`, are one file there: two byte-distinct slugs
    pass a byte-equality check and the second write silently replaces the
    first (issue #152, the same symptom as an exact duplicate).

    NFC then case-fold covers both spellings, and is a pure function of its
    argument: no clock, no environment, no set iteration, so nothing about
    the exporter's determinism moves.

    Only the uniqueness KEY folds. This decides WHETHER two concepts collide
    and never what either of them is called: the emitted filename stays the
    concept's own slug, capitals, accents and normalization intact.

    The cost is deliberate. On a case-SENSITIVE filesystem `readme.md` and
    `README.md` really are two files, and folding bumps one of them anyway.
    That is the trade taken on purpose: WHICH concepts collide is then the
    same question everywhere, rather than one whose answer depends on the
    filesystem under the export.

    What that does NOT promise, because only the KEY folds: the emitted
    filename still follows the source filename's own spelling, so a concept
    whose source is named in NFD produces different bundle bytes from the
    same concept named in NFC. Normalization spelling is a per-tree property
    (APFS preserves whichever bytes were written; macOS git's default
    core.precomposeunicode hands them back as NFC), so two clones of one repo
    can still differ there. Folding closes the collision axis and nothing

    Quoting is resolved FIRST and the inline comment second, which is the

    scalar. Doing it the other way round truncates `"... as PR #214"` at the
    hash and then removes the orphaned opening quote, so the loss leaves no
    trace for the caller to notice.

    Three paths:

    * double-quoted: scan to the closing `"`, honouring backslash escapes so
      `\\"` does not close the scalar. The escapes read back are the ones in
      ``_DQ_ESCAPES``; any other backslash pair is left verbatim rather than
      guessed at, so `"\\d+"` reaches the caller as `\\d+`. That guarantee is
      narrower than it looks, and deliberately not sold as more: a hand-written
      `"C:\\path\\to"` resolves to `C:\\path`, a TAB, `o`, because `\\t` IS in
      the table. Values this exporter wrote survive a write/read round trip
      except for control characters, which ``_yaml_quote`` writes as `\\xNN`
      and this table does not read back.
    * single-quoted: scan to the closing `'`, collapsing a doubled `''` to one
      `'` (the only escape a YAML single-quoted scalar has).
    * plain, or a quote that never closes the scalar: strip a trailing inline
      comment, then apply the historic quote strip, which is CONDITIONAL on
      the value beginning with a quote. That condition is the whole of its
      business. A YAML plain scalar cannot open with `"` or `'` (both are
      indicators there), so a value that does not open with one was never a
      quoted scalar this parser tried and failed to unquote, and taking a
      character off its end is pure loss. `The so-called "bridge"`,
      `it is 'fine'` and `monitor is 12"` are ordinary prose that PyYAML
      round-trips unchanged, and the unconditional ``strip('"').strip("'")``
      this replaces ate the last character of each, silently, in the
      function issue #151 names.

    Whitespace is trimmed as YAML trims a plain scalar, spaces and tabs only
    (plus a trailing CR on a CRLF source). ``str.strip()`` is Unicode-aware
    and took U+00A0 with it, so a description pasted out of a browser lost
    the non-breaking space it ended on.

    A quote counts as closing only where ``_closes_quoted_scalar`` says one
    may (nothing but a comment behind it). Where it does not, the scan is
    abandoned and the value takes the plain path: `'Michael's bridge'` and
    `"He said "stop" once"` keep every character between their outer quotes,
    and only that outer pair (the delimiters the line was trying to use) is
    stripped. PyYAML rejects both lines outright, so there is no
    YAML-conformant answer to defer to here; the choice is between keeping a
    malformed value whole and silently dropping its tail, and this parser is
    tolerant on purpose.

    ``was_quoted`` is load-bearing rather than informational: with quotes

    alone. An indented `---` inside an open block scalar is content (issue
    #151: `line.strip() == "---"` closed the block early, lost the remaining
    keys and leaked four frontmatter lines into the body); an indented `---`
    anywhere else still closes, because holding the closer to column 0
    unconditionally costs the body of every file that merely indents its
    fence. Such a file has no block scalar open at all, and the scan then
    either reads on to the next column-0 `---` and swallows the text between
    as frontmatter, or finds no fence and reports the whole file as body with
    no keys. Both are silent losses of exactly the shape #151 is about, so
    the state the two cases differ by is the state this scan tracks.

    A leading UTF-8 BOM is dropped before anything else. ``str.rstrip`` does
    not remove U+FEFF, so `\\ufeff---` never equalled `---` and a
    BOM-prefixed source was read as having no frontmatter at all: every key
    gone, the title fallen back to the body H1, and the raw frontmatter text
    emitted into the concept body.

# and the `]` behind it is bare again, closing the link text and handing
# `(evil)` to the source as the destination. Measured, not reasoned.
#
# `<` is in the set because CommonMark passes inline raw HTML through
# untouched: a title of `a</li><li><a href='...'>evil</a>` rendered as four
# list items under a header claiming three, the extra ones carrying an
# attacker-chosen href, which is the same outcome as the newline route and

    let a field leave its own position:

    * a line break ends the entry, so everything after it reads as another
      entry. The header then states one concept while the list shows two, and
      the fabricated one carries whatever link it likes. A `title: |` block
      scalar arrives multi-line from the source itself; a single-line
      `description: "a\\n* [x](...)"` gets there too, now that a double-quoted
      scalar's escapes are read back. Every control character becomes a space
      and the result is stripped, so a field spans exactly one line and adds
      no trailing whitespace of its own.
    * an unescaped `]` closes the link text early and lets the `(...)` behind
      it become a destination the source chose, which needs no line break at
      all. `[`, `]` and `\\` are escaped; CommonMark renders a
      backslash-escaped punctuation mark as the bare character, so a
      legitimate bracket still reads as a bracket. `(` and `)` need no escape:
      a destination can only follow an unescaped `]`, and after the escape
      above the only unescaped `]` on the line is the one this renderer
      writes, whose destination is the concept's own file.
    * raw inline HTML is passed straight through by CommonMark, so
      `a</li><li><a href='...'>evil</a>` in a title closes the entry's own
      list item and opens further ones with a link the source chose. `<` is
      escaped for that, which closes the autolink route (`<https://...>`) with
      it.

    That is the whole guarantee: one entry per concept, whose link is that
    concept's own file. It covers only what this function is given. The link
    DESTINATION between the two fields is source-derived as well (the slug is
    a source filename), and it is ``_md_destination``, not this, that keeps it
    inside the bundle. Other inline markdown still renders, exactly as it does

    `*`, a code span between backticks, an HTML entity such as `&auml;`. None
    of those can move an entry's link or fabricate a second entry. The concept

    "overview-2-2" rather than stealing "overview-3" from its potential
    natural owner.
