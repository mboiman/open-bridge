"""Pytest suite for scripts/standing-orders.py.

CONTRACT, this file is the authoritative spec for that surface.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Skills already do progressive disclosure: the name and the
description sit in context permanently, the body arrives on invocation. Standing
orders never got the same treatment. Every order carrying `scope: always` is
read in full at session start and matched against every sub-agent dispatch, so
an advisory order that fires twice a month is paid on every turn and again on
every fan-out. This adds the missing half of the skill contract to orders.

    THE FRONTMATTER GAINS THREE FIELDS

        load      eager | on-trigger      default: eager
        triggers  the vocabulary that fetches the body
        summary   the one line that stays in context

    `load` DEFAULTS TO EAGER, and that direction is the whole safety argument.
    A fork that has never heard of the field keeps every order it has and
    loses nothing; it simply saves nothing either. Fail-closed would mean the
    silent loss of a guardrail, which is the failure this repo spends most of
    its test surface preventing.

    load_order(path) -> dict
        Frontmatter plus the derived load policy, with `path` attached.

    collect_orders(repo_root) -> list[dict]
        Every `protocols/standing-orders/**/*.md` carrying `scope: always`,
        sorted by path. `README.md` and `_`-prefixed files are not orders.

    check_orders(orders) -> list[str]
        Violations, empty when the contract holds:
          - `on-trigger` with no non-empty `triggers`  -> UNREACHABLE
          - `on-trigger` with no `summary`             -> INVISIBLE
          - a `summary` longer than SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS  -> the index is always-on
          - an unknown `load` value

        The first two are the point. An order that loads on a trigger nobody
        can say, or that never announces itself in the index, is present in the
        tree and absent from every session. It reads as enforced and is not.

    render_index(orders) -> str
        The always-on surface after this change: one line per order carrying
        its name, its trigger vocabulary and its summary. Deterministic.
        Eager orders are marked as already loaded so a reader does not fetch a
        body it is holding.

    eager_paths(orders) -> list[str]
        The bodies Phase 1 still reads in full.

    main(argv) -> int
        `--check` validates the contract, `--index` prints the index.

EVERY GATE HAS A FIXTURE THAT TRIPS IT.

# A file under protocols/standing-orders/ IS an order by convention: that is
# exactly what collect_orders globs. When its frontmatter cannot be read,
# `_frontmatter` returns {} and `scope` becomes "", so `collect_orders` drops it
# for not being `scope: always` — the same silent exit an org-scoped order takes
# on purpose. The two are indistinguishable downstream, and only one of them is
# somebody's guardrail going missing.
#
# Found 2026-08-30 by an adversarial audit, with two fixtures that both declare
# `scope: always, enforcement: blocking`: one carrying a single comment line
# above the fence, one with an unquoted colon inside a value. Both vanished from
# --index, and --check reported "1 order(s) valid" and exited 0.
#
# The CI backstop could not have caught it either: it extracts frontmatter with
# awk (which reads both fixtures happily) and globs -maxdepth 1, so it never
# enters user/ — the one directory AGENTS.md designates for hand-written orders.
