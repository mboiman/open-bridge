"""Pytest suite for scripts/gen-board.py (the work/board.md generator).

CONTRACT, this file is the authoritative spec for the generator's surface.

    parse_status(md: Path) -> dict
        Reads a STATUS.md and returns the row data the board renders:
            slug        the parent directory's name
            desc        frontmatter `headline:`, else the first `# ` H1 in the
                        body, else the slug
            type        frontmatter `type:`,    else the em-dash placeholder
            context     frontmatter `context:`, else the placeholder
            since       frontmatter `created:`, else `last_updated:`, else the
                        placeholder
            status      frontmatter `status:`,  else "?"
            blocked_by  frontmatter `blocked_by:`, else ""

        Frontmatter parsing is DELEGATED, never hand-rolled here. The repo's
        reference implementation is scripts/okf-export.py's parse_frontmatter,
        which is covered by scripts/tests/test_okf_export.py and agrees with
        PyYAML on well-formed input. A second hand-rolled parser in this file
        is the defect this suite exists to prevent: it drifted for months and
        lost content that a real YAML parser keeps.

    collect(folder: Path) -> tuple[list[dict], list[str]]
        Every immediate subdirectory holding a STATUS.md becomes a row, sorted
        by directory name. Subdirectories without one are reported separately
        by name, never silently dropped.

    main() -> int
        No arguments      regenerate work/board.md and print a summary line.
        --check           print the same summary and write NOTHING.
        anything else     usage on stderr, exit 2, and write NOTHING. An
                          unrecognised flag must never fall through to the
                          write path: `gen-board.py --help` regenerating the
                          board is how this was found.

        Streams are collected and counted but never contribute to WIP, which
        is doing + review over work/tasks/ only.

NOT covered on purpose: the exact markdown layout of board.md. It is a view
and its wording changes; the tests assert the data that reaches it.
