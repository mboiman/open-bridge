"""Pytest suite for scripts/context-index.py.

CONTRACT, this file is the authoritative spec for that surface.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `context-budget.yaml` measures what a session loads and holds
it to a ceiling. It cannot make anything smaller. Two always-on sources are
large because they are whole files where only a table of contents is needed
before the work starts: a registry naming every repo, customer and workspace,
and any other declared map an instance keeps. A session needs to know THAT a
customer called `example-customer` exists and roughly what it is. It does not
need the customer's fifteen fields until somebody names it.

Skills have had this split since the beginning: the name and one line stay
resident, the body arrives on invocation. Standing orders got it when the load
contract landed. This adds it to declared map sources, and does it once rather
than a third time in a third shape.

    THE CARD (what stays resident)

        keep       top-level keys emitted VERBATIM, comments and all
        sections   top-level maps whose children become one index line each
        label      the child field that supplies that line (default:
                   `description`), truncated to `label_chars` (default 120)

    Anything else present in the file is named under "also present", never
    dropped. A card that silently omits a key is the exact failure the budget
    was built to stop, one layer down.

    THE BODY (what arrives on demand)

        --get <dotted.path>    the raw text of that block, comments included
        --list                 every path --get accepts

    Slices are RAW TEXT, never re-serialized YAML. Re-serializing drops
    comments, and in these files the comments carry the reasoning: which
    branch is the running one, which board is closed, why a path is what it
    is. A reader that strips them answers the letter of the question and loses
    the part that stops a wrong action.

    FAIL-OPEN. A file with no `card:` declaration is still indexable: every
    top-level map with map children is treated as a section. An instance that
    has never heard of this feature loses nothing by not declaring.

# none of them attached to a key. Among them:
#
#     # scope: bks — org/customer registry, routet zu bks-bridge, NIE open-bridge.
#     # PERSONAL-tier ecosystem extension (NEVER promoted to public/bks)
#     # ... so this content never reaches an upstream
#
# Promote routing is structural, so nothing was UNSAFE. But a session that only
# ever sees the card had no way to learn that the file it is holding is PII that
# must never be published, and that is the one sentence a header exists to say.
# 2 018 bytes across those three files, 0.63 % of that instance's always-on
# surface, and it is bounded by the item's own max_bytes like everything else.
#
# The split rule is free: `_with_leading_comments` already decides, by
# contiguity, which comments belong to the first key. The header is what is left
# ABOVE that, so the two can never overlap and nothing is carried twice.
