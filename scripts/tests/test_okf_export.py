"""Pytest suite for scripts/okf-export.py (the Tier 1 OKF v0.2 exporter).

CONTRACT — this file is the authoritative spec for the exporter's public
surface (read against scripts/extract-frontmatter.py and
scripts/gen-board.py for the existing hand-rolled-parsing conventions this
repo already uses). scripts/okf-export.py implements this exact surface:

    OKF_VERSION: str                                            = "0.2"
    EXPORTER_VERSION: str                                       = "1.0"
        The exporter's OWN version, deliberately a separate constant from
        the spec version so the two can never drift into each other.

    default_generated_by() -> str
        f"okf-export/{EXPORTER_VERSION}". Names the transformation that
        produced the bundle document, NEVER the author of the underlying
        knowledge. Must not read git, $USER, or any environment.

    normalize_timestamp(value: str) -> str | None
        Two accepted shapes, everything else -> None:
        a full `YYYY-MM-DD` calendar date -> widened to `<date>T00:00:00Z`;
        an ISO datetime that already carries an explicit offset -> verbatim.
        None for a partial date, the literal `YYYY-MM-DD` placeholder, a
        calendar-impossible date, a naive datetime, free text and "". The
        strict regex gate runs BEFORE date.fromisoformat, which on Python
        3.11+ would otherwise accept `20260702` and `2026-W27-1`. Pure:
        reads only its argument, never the clock.

    parse_frontmatter(text: str) -> tuple[dict, str]
        Hand-rolled (NO PyYAML dependency). Reads the same flat
        `key: value` scalars as gen-board.py's parse_status() and skips
        leading `# ...` comment lines (the
        `# yaml-language-server: $schema=...` prolog convention) before the
        first `---` fence, but diverges from that script on two points:

        RESOLUTION ORDER. Quoting is resolved BEFORE inline comments, the
        order YAML itself uses. A `#` inside a double- or single-quoted
        scalar is a literal character (`"... as PR #214"` keeps its issue
        number); a backslash-escaped quote does not close a double-quoted
        scalar, and the two-character escapes in _DQ_ESCAPES are read back
        (every one _yaml_quote emits, plus YAML's `\\/`; a control character,
        which _yaml_quote writes as `\\xNN`, is NOT read back and returns as
        four literal characters); a doubled `''` inside a single-quoted
        scalar collapses to one `'`. On an UNQUOTED scalar a ` #` (start of
        value, or after whitespace) still opens a comment and is still
        stripped, so `value#nospace` stays whole and `key: # note` resolves
        to "". A QUOTED value is never a block-scalar indicator:
        `title: "|"` is the one-character string.

        WHERE A QUOTE CLOSES. A quote closes a quoted scalar only where a
        quote may close one: with nothing behind it, or an inline comment
        (`"a"# tight` resolves to `a`, since the value has already ended at
        the quote). Anything else means that quote was a character inside the
        value, and the scalar then degrades to the plain path WHOLE rather
        than being cut there: `'Michael's bridge'` and `"He said "stop" once"`
        keep every character. PyYAML rejects both of those lines outright, so
        there is no conformant answer to defer to; the choice is between
        keeping a malformed value whole and silently dropping its tail, and
        for a deliberately tolerant parser the second is the worse failure.

        FENCE COLUMN. A `---` fence counts only at column 0, opening and
        closing alike (trailing whitespace, and a trailing CR on a CRLF
        source, are tolerated). A block-scalar continuation line is indented
        by definition, so an indented `---` is content and never ends the
        block. A file whose first non-blank line is an INDENTED `---`
        therefore has no frontmatter.

        Returns (frontmatter_dict, body_text). A file with NO frontmatter
        block returns ({}, text): the body is the untouched original text.

    concept_slug(path: Path) -> str
        `STATUS.md` -> parent directory name (task/stream slug, same
        convention as gen-board.py). Any other filename -> the file's stem.

    derive_title(frontmatter: dict, body: str, fallback: str) -> str
        frontmatter["title"] -> first `# ` H1 line in body -> fallback.

    derive_description(frontmatter: dict, body: str) -> str
        frontmatter["description"] -> frontmatter["summary"] ->
        frontmatter["headline"] -> "" (never derived from body).

    resolve_wikilinks(text: str, slug_to_relpath: dict[str, str]) -> tuple[str, list[str]]
        Replaces every `[[slug]]` occurrence where slug is a kebab-case
        identifier (`[a-z][a-z0-9-]*`): if slug is a key in
        slug_to_relpath, becomes a markdown link `[slug](relpath)`;
        otherwise the `[[slug]]` text is left completely untouched (OKF
        tolerates dangling references; rewriting them would corrupt
        content) and the slug is appended to the returned unresolved list.
        Non-kebab bracket pairs — e.g. bash `[[ -f file ]]` conditionals
        inside code blocks — never match and are never reported.

    discover_sources(root: Path, scope: str) -> list[Path]
        scope == "user": every work/tasks/*/STATUS.md,
        work/streams/*/STATUS.md, work/done/*/*/STATUS.md, every
        */deliverables/*.md under work/, every docs/**/*.md, rules/**/*.md
        and examples/**/*.md under root.
        scope == "core": ONLY docs/**/*.md + examples/**/*.md (work/ and
        rules/ excluded entirely — this is the public-safe subset for a
        demo export).
        Any other scope string raises ValueError.
        Those patterns are NOT a literal inside this function. They live in
        the module-level _SCOPE_PATTERNS and are read through patterns_for(),
        which is also what scanned_dirs() (and therefore write_bundle's
        destination guard) reads. ONE pattern source, two consumers: a second
        hand-kept list would drift the day a pattern is added to only one of
        them, and the walk would resume eating its own output.

    patterns_for(scope: str) -> tuple[str, ...]
        _SCOPE_PATTERNS[scope]; any other scope raises ValueError, with the
        expected-values half of the message derived from _SCOPE_PATTERNS so
        it cannot drift either.

    _pattern_prefix(pattern: str) -> str
        The fixed leading path of a glob pattern, up to its first globbed
        segment: `docs/**/*.md` -> "docs", `work/tasks/*/STATUS.md` ->
        "work/tasks", `work/**/deliverables/*.md` -> "work". Segment-wise,
        never a string prefix, so `docs-bundle` is not inside `docs`. A
        pattern whose first segment is already globbed yields "".

    scanned_dirs(root: Path, scope: str) -> list[Path]
        The sorted, deduplicated, RESOLVED directories discover_sources
        reads under, derived from patterns_for(scope) via _pattern_prefix. An
        empty prefix maps to root itself rather than being dropped, so a
        future whole-tree pattern cannot silently under-guard. A directory
        that does not exist yet is still returned: it is scanned the moment
        it appears. The JOINED path is what resolves, not just root:
        resolving the root alone and appending the prefix compares a
        symlinked `docs/` on its LINK path while --out is compared on its
        real one, and the two then never match.

    all_scanned_dirs(root: Path) -> list[tuple[Path, tuple[str, ...]]]
        The union over every scope of scanned_dirs(root, scope), each
        directory paired with the sorted scope names that walk it. This, not
        scanned_dirs alone, is what write_bundle's destination guard reads:
        the bundle outlives the run that wrote it, so a destination only the
        OTHER scope walks is still re-ingested. Sorted by path, so a given
        tree always produces the same refusal.

    concept_type_for(path: Path, root: Path) -> str
        .../work/tasks/<slug>/STATUS.md      -> "task"
        .../work/streams/<slug>/STATUS.md    -> "stream"
        .../work/done/<month>/<slug>/STATUS.md -> "task"
        .../deliverables/*.md                -> "deliverable"
        docs/**/*.md                         -> "doc"
        rules/**/*.md                        -> "rule"
        examples/**/*.md                     -> "example"

    build_concept(path: Path, root: Path) -> dict
        {"slug": str, "okf_type": str, "title": str, "description": str,
         "resource": str, "generated_at": str | None,
         "bridge_status": str | None, "tags": list[str], "body": str}
        `generated_at` <- normalize_timestamp(frontmatter["last_updated"] or
        frontmatter["created"] or ""). `bridge_status` <-
        frontmatter["status"] or None — a Bridge WORKFLOW state, never OKF's
        own `status`. `tags` <- [frontmatter["status"]] +
        [frontmatter["context"]] (only the ones present), else [].
        `body` is the RAW markdown body (wikilinks not yet resolved).

    dedupe_slugs(concepts: list[dict]) -> None
        Mutates concept["slug"] in place so no two concepts of one type name
        the same FILE, and no concept names a reserved one ("index", "log"),
        which write_bundle generates itself for every populated type
        directory. A colliding concept takes the LOWEST FREE numeric suffix
        on its own natural slug (`slug-2`, `slug-3`, ...), free meaning
        claimed by no other concept of that type and not reserved. Two
        properties follow, and both are asserted: a concept KEEPS its
        natural slug wherever it can, so the duplicate is what moves and a
        bumped name can never land on a slug another concept owns, whether
        that owner is discovered before or after it; and the suffix is
        appended to the concept's own slug rather than to a parsed-off stem,
        so a duplicate of a natural `overview-2` becomes `overview-2-2` and
        never steals `overview-3`.

        THE NAMESPACE IS THE FILESYSTEM'S, not the byte string's. Both the
        claim and the reserved test are keyed on _fs_identity(slug) =
        unicodedata.normalize("NFC", slug).casefold(), because a slug becomes
        a filename and `readme`/`README`, or the NFC and NFD spellings of
        `café`, are ONE file on a case-insensitive or normalizing filesystem
        (the macOS default). Byte-keyed, both concepts keep their natural
        slug, the second write lands on the first file, and one body is gone
        with the manifest still counting it; a source named `Index.md` is
        destroyed by the generated `<type>/index.md` written after it. Only
        the KEY folds: the emitted filename stays the concept's own slug
        (`readme.md` + `README-2.md`), and a bumped memory slug still
        satisfies _SAFE_SLUG_RE. On a case-SENSITIVE filesystem this bumps a
        pair that would not have collided there, which is the deliberate
        trade: one tree exports to one bundle on every platform.

        Deterministic: both passes walk the list in discovery order (it
        arrives pre-sorted by source path) and try suffixes from 2 upward,
        so the assignment depends on the input list alone. _fs_identity is
        pure, so folding adds no new input to that.

        NOT folded: the slug -> relpath index write_bundle builds for
        wikilink resolution. The wikilink grammar is ASCII lowercase kebab,
        so a folded link index could only differ from an exact one where the
        target slug could never have been named by a link anyway, and it
        would have to choose arbitrarily between two now-distinct files.

    write_bundle(root, out_dir, scope, memory_dir=None, generated_by=None) -> dict
        Orchestrates discover_sources -> build_concept (all) ->
        dedupe_slugs -> a slug->relpath index -> resolve_wikilinks over every
        body -> writes
        out_dir/<type>/<slug>.md for every populated type, writes
        out_dir/<type>/index.md per populated type directory, and writes
        out_dir/index.md (root) whose frontmatter carries
        `okf_version: "0.2"` AND NOTHING ELSE (the one key OKF permits in an
        index file). `generated_by` is run-wide, defaulting to
        default_generated_by(). Deterministic + idempotent: re-running with
        unchanged input produces BYTE-IDENTICAL files, in a FRESH INTERPRETER
        as much as in the same one. Set and dict iteration over strings is
        fixed within a process and varies between processes (PYTHONHASHSEED),
        so an in-process re-run cannot see a hash-ordered field at all: every
        ordering that reaches the output has to come from a sorted list or
        from the discovery-ordered concept list, never from a set.
        Two concepts of one type naming the same file (compared in the same
        folded namespace dedupe_slugs assigns in) raise
        BundleDestinationError (exit 1 via main), checked after dedupe_slugs
        and BEFORE the output directory is cleared, so the invariant fails
        loudly with the previous bundle intact rather than silently dropping
        a concept. Returns a manifest:
        {"okf_version": "0.2", "scope": scope, "concept_count": int,
        "generated_by": str, "concepts_without_generated_at": int,
        "unresolved_wikilinks": list[str]} — the undated figure is a COUNT,
        never a list of source paths, because the manifest is printed.

        INDEX ENTRIES. Every index file lists exactly as many entries as it
        has things to list (a type index one per concept of that type, the
        root index one per populated type directory), each on ONE line, and
        every entry's link points inside the bundle. A type index is the only
        generated file that interpolates source text into markdown, and both
        fields it interpolates go through _md_inline: control characters
        (every line break included, plus U+2028/U+2029) become spaces, and
        `[`, `]` and `\\` are backslash-escaped. Without that, a newline in a
        title or description splits its bullet and the overflow reads as an
        entry the header does not count, and an unescaped `]` hands the
        `(...)` behind it to the source as a link destination. The concept
        FILES need none of this: every source-derived value there is written
        through _yaml_quote.

        DESTINATION GUARDS, all three raising BundleDestinationError (exit 1
        via main) and all three running BEFORE discover_sources walks
        anything and BEFORE the output directory is cleared, so a refused
        run costs an error message and leaves both the sources and any
        previous bundle untouched:
          * out_dir is --root or an ancestor of it (clearing would delete
            the source tree). Checked FIRST, so its wording is stable.
          * out_dir lies inside ANY directory ANY scope walks, or contains
            one. `--out` must be outside every all_scanned_dirs(root) entry,
            NOT merely outside this run's own read set: `dist/okf-bundle`
            qualifies, `docs/`, `examples/`, `work/`, `rules/` and anything
            under them do not, in either scope. Without this the walk
            re-ingests the previous run's own output as source material, the
            concept count climbs on every run, and the byte-identical
            guarantee above is false (issue #153).
            Containment is segment-wise, so the sibling `docs-bundle` is
            legal. Comparison is on RESOLVED paths, so a symlinked or
            dot-segmented `--out` is judged on where it really lands and a
            symlinked `docs/` on where it really reads. The segments are
            compared in the same folded namespace dedupe_slugs uses
            (_fs_path_identity applies _fs_identity per segment), so `DOCS/`
            and `docs/`, one directory on the macOS default filesystem, are
            one directory to the guard too. Folded rather than compared by
            inode because the guard must judge directories that do not exist
            yet, which is exactly a fresh instance.
            The refusal is deliberately WIDER than the glob in two ways,
            both fail-closed against silent corruption: it covers scopes
            this run is not in, and _pattern_prefix collapses
            `work/**/deliverables/*.md` to `work`, so all of `work/` is
            refused even where nothing there could be globbed back in. The
            message names `dist/okf-bundle`, a destination that works.
          * under user scope with a memory_dir, out_dir overlaps that memory
            dir in either direction. Gated on `scope == "user" and
            memory_dir is not None` so it mirrors the run's actual read set:
            core scope never walks the memory dir, so it never refuses one.
            The exporter is strictly a READER of that (usually out-of-repo)
            store and must never rmtree into it.

    Emitted concept frontmatter, in order, empty fields OMITTED:
        type, title, description?, resource, generated { by, at? },
        bridge_status?, tags?

    NEVER EMITTED, and each an explicit decision rather than an oversight:
        timestamp    superseded by generated.at in v0.2; not dual-emitted,
                     because the spec's legacy fallback applies only when
                     `generated` is absent, which it never is.
        status       OKF `status` is document readiness; a Bridge status is
                     work state, and `draft` is a homograph across the two.
        verified     nothing in a Bridge instance is a verification event,
                     and trust tiers are derived purely from this field.
        sources      `related:` is see-also, not derived-from; a fabricated
                     entry manufactures a lineage edge consumers walk.
        stale_after  a consumer GATE; no Bridge field says when a document
                     stops being true. If ever adopted it is an absolute ISO
                     instant with an offset, never a bare date, never a TTL.

    main(argv: list[str] | None = None) -> int
        argparse CLI: --root (default "."), --out (required), --scope
        {"user","core"} (default "user"; invalid choice -> argparse
        SystemExit), --memory-dir, --generated-by ACTOR. A --generated-by
        value that is not an OKF actor (`<producer>/<version>`, `human:<id>`
        or `process:<id>`) -> stderr + exit 1, no bundle written. A `human:`
        actor with --scope core -> stderr WARNING, still exits 0.
        Non-existent/non-dir --root -> prints to stderr, returns a non-zero
        exit code (no traceback). On success prints a one-line summary and
        returns 0.

Hermetic: every test builds its own synthetic mini-instance under tmp_path
(generic names only — "acme", "sample-task" — never real repo/customer
content) and never touches the real repo tree beyond importing the module
under test.
