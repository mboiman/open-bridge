"""Pytest suite for scripts/check-reachability.py.

CONTRACT, this file is the authoritative spec for that surface.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The context budget proves the always-on layer is SMALL. The
context index proves a body can be FETCHED. Neither proves the thing both are
for: that a session still knows the body exists. A cut that removes the last
mention of `infra/channels/` leaves every guard green — the budget is happier,
every route that remains resolves, every card round-trips — and the capability
is gone, because nothing will ever go looking for it.

That failure is silent by construction, and this repo has already paid for it
twice in one week: three standing orders targeted sub-agents that no instance
has, and the org-overlay import anchored on a line that had been deleted. Both
read as enforced and did nothing.

    THE CONTRACT

        Every config family the tree actually has must be NAMED, by its path,
        somewhere in the always-on surface.

    DERIVED, NEVER LISTED. The families come from the tree — the cluster
    wrappers' subdirectories plus the fixed top-level ones — for the same
    reason `AGENTS.md` stopped carrying a table of rules: a list written once
    is a list that is wrong later, and it is wrong in the direction that hides
    the newest thing.

    BY PATH, not by prose. "the machine inventory" is a name; `infra/remotes/`
    is a route. Only the second one can be followed, and only the second one
    breaks loudly when the directory moves.

    THE SURFACE IS THE METER'S. `always_on_text` comes from
    `measure-context.py`, so the set of files this checks against is the same
    set the budget gates. Two definitions of "always-on" would mean a family
    named in something the session does not actually load.
