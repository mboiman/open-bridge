"""Regression tests for the scope router — scripts/categorize-commits.py.

`classify_file()` decides which upstream a file may reach. `core` means the file
ships to **bks-lab/open-bridge**, a PUBLIC MIT repo, so a wrong `core` is a leak
and a wrong non-`core` silently cuts this instance off from upstream updates.
Both directions are asserted here.

The router is an ORDERED denylist that ends in `return "core"` — fail-OPEN. Every
path family added after a rule was written therefore defaults to shipping. These
tests pin the families that were found misrouted on 2026-08-01, and — just as
importantly — pin the paths that must NOT move, because the obvious
generalisations of the fix would route real PII into the public repo.

Portability: every path below is either a pure pattern-match (no filesystem
touch inside classify_file at all) or a generic synthetic fixture built by the
`synth_repo` fixture in a throwaway `tmp_path`. No test depends on any specific
Bridge instance's real tree — this file runs the same in any conformant clone,
including open-bridge itself, where none of the real instance data exists.
