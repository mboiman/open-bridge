"""Pytest suite for scripts/check-doc-routes.py.

CONTRACT, this file is the authoritative spec for that surface.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Trimming an always-on file works by replacing an explanation
with a pointer to the file that owns it. That trade is only sound while the
pointer resolves. A pointer at a file that was renamed, or never existed, is
strictly worse than the paragraph it replaced: the paragraph was at least
readable, and a dead pointer fails silently, at the moment somebody needed the
thing it pointed at.

So every path an always-on document names has to resolve, and that has to be a
build gate rather than a habit.

    ROUTED_DOCS
        The always-on documents whose pointers are load-bearing.

    extract_routes(text) -> list[str]
        Markdown links only, `[label](path)`. A link is a navigation promise;
        a backticked path is prose, and prose names things that legitimately do
        not exist in a given clone.

        That line was drawn by measurement, not taste. Checking backticked paths
        too produced 24 violations on a healthy tree and not one of them was a
        bug: path fragments written for readability (`personas/` for
        `identity/personas/`), USER data absent in a fresh clone by design
        (`work/log.md`, `rules/user/`), derived and gitignored files
        (`.bridge/skill-scope.md`), a sibling repo (`wiki/`), and one branch name
        that merely looks like a directory (`user/`). A gate with 24 false
        positives on a healthy repo is not a gate; it is a thing people learn to
        skip. So a load-bearing pointer is written as a link, and then it is
        checked.

        A placeholder (`workflow/projects/<slug>.yaml`), an external URL and a
        bare anchor are not routes. A path with an anchor is returned without
        it: the file is what must exist.

    check_routes(repo_root, docs) -> list[str]
        One violation per unresolvable route, naming the document it sits in.

    main(argv) -> int
        0 when every route resolves, 1 otherwise.
