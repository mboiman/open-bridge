"""Validate Bridge config files against their schemas.

Wrapper around `check-jsonschema` (https://check-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/)
that knows the Bridge schema-bearing surfaces (persona, theme, channel,
remote, mandant, calendar). Iterates each surface, finds instance files
via glob, and validates them against the surface's `_schema.yaml` using
JSON Schema Draft 2020-12.

Also validates that every `rules/*.md` carries an explicit `scope:`
frontmatter value (core|org|user|private) — the field `/promote` and
`/bridge-sync` route on. A rule with missing or invalid scope fails the
check (this is what keeps generic CORE rules from leaking to open-bridge).

This is the bridge-internal config validator. For ecosystem.yaml
cross-reference checks, run `validate-ecosystem.py` (separate concern).

Setup:
  pipx install check-jsonschema      # one-time
  # or via uv: uv tool install check-jsonschema

Exit codes:
  0 — all instances valid (or check-jsonschema absent → schema surfaces
      advisory-skipped; missing the optional tool alone never fails)
  1 — at least one validation error
  2 — setup error (unknown --surface, etc.)

Usage:
  scripts/validate-bridge.py                  # validate everything
  scripts/validate-bridge.py --surface theme  # validate one surface
  scripts/validate-bridge.py --list           # show discovered files
