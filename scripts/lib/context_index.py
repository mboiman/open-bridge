"""A table of contents for a declared map source, and one block on demand.

Shared by `scripts/context-index.py` (the CLI a session calls) and
`scripts/measure-context.py` (which measures the card rather than the file
once one is declared). The contract is specified by
`scripts/tests/test_context_index.py`.

TWO DELIBERATE CHOICES, both cost something and both are the point.

SLICES ARE RAW TEXT. This module parses YAML only far enough to know where a
block begins and ends; it never re-serializes. A round trip through a YAML
loader is lossy in exactly the direction that matters here: comments. In the
registries this feature exists for, the comments are where the reasoning
lives — which branch is the running one, which board is closed, why a path is
not the obvious one. A reader that answers `--get` with clean re-serialized
YAML answers the letter of the question and drops the half that stops a wrong
action.

THE CARD NAMES EVERY TOP-LEVEL KEY. Kept whole, expanded into an index, or
merely named — but never absent. An index that silently omits a key is the
same failure as a budget that silently omits a file, one layer down: the thing
does not look missing, it looks like it was never there.
