"""Categorize commits by scope (core / org / user / personal) for /promote routing.

Mirrors the path → scope table in rules/operations.md § CORE/USER Separation.
Run from repo root.

Usage:
    scripts/categorize-commits.py                    # since last open-bridge snapshot
    scripts/categorize-commits.py --since 2026-05-03
    scripts/categorize-commits.py --range open-bridge/main..HEAD
    scripts/categorize-commits.py --commit <sha>     # detail for one commit
    scripts/categorize-commits.py --json             # machine-readable output

Output shows per-commit category + file-level breakdown for MIXED commits,
so /promote can decide which files to cherry-pick by path-selection rather
than full-commit cherry-pick (which fails on disjoint histories anyway).

# describes what it depicts, never where it lives, and only an enumerated
# family may claim that exemption, which is why the set above is a list and not
