"""Can a session still find what this Bridge has?

    python3 scripts/check-reachability.py             # contract + scenarios
    python3 scripts/check-reachability.py --families  # what was discovered
    python3 scripts/check-reachability.py --mutate    # prove the check bites

The context budget proves the always-on layer is SMALL. The context index
proves a body can be FETCHED. Neither proves the thing both exist for: that a
session still knows the body is there. A cut that removes the last mention of
`infra/channels/` leaves every other guard green — the budget is happier, every
remaining route resolves, every card round-trips — and the capability is gone,
because nothing will ever go looking for it.

TWO CHECKS, and the second is the one a person would call a simulation.

THE CONTRACT. Every config family the tree actually has is named, BY ITS PATH,
somewhere in the always-on surface. Derived from the tree, never from a list:
a list written once is wrong later, and wrong in the direction that hides the
newest thing. By path and not by prose, because "the machine inventory" is a
name and `infra/remotes/` is a route — only the second can be followed, and
only the second breaks loudly when the directory moves.

THE SCENARIOS. One per thing a person actually asks for, each naming the
vocabulary they would use and the family that has to be reachable from it.
This is the chain the cuts were supposed to preserve, walked end to end:
somebody says "wake the machine", the resident layer carries both that word
and the route, and the route resolves to real content. An instance adds its
own in `reachability-scenarios.yaml` — its machine names, its customers, its
own words.

WHAT COUNTS AS RESIDENT is whatever `measure-context.py` measures, and that is
deliberate: two definitions of always-on would let a pointer live in something
the session never loads. A deferred standing order does not count. Its body
arrives on a trigger, and the trigger is the thing that went missing.
